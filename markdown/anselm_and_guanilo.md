After writing [A very rough moral theory of everything](./a_very_rough_moral_theory_of_everything.html), I received a very thoughtful response from a good friend of mine, Miles Hubbard. Now, a full five months later, it's high time I give that response a well-thought-out reply of my own. What follows is my friend's writing (slightly condensed), interspersed with my own thoughts.

---

<blockquote>
In a real and important sense, I believe that you and I have a very similar notion of morality. If an
equivalence relation over morality-notions could be defined, I would not be too surprised to find
a proof suggesting their coincidence. In this sense, we are rather like Anselm and Gaunilo
discussing God; we agree in point of fact that there is such-and-such a God, and yet disagree upon
what counts as a valid argument for one.

It seems unfair to say that you and I share a mutual morality and not paraphrase what I perceive
you mean about your morality.... As such, I will attempt to sketch what it is that I believe you believe.

Given a body of context (that is, a collection of sentences that are in some sense true), every entity
named in the context is constantly formulating a new collection of sentences, some of which may
agree with the original context while others differ, and this new body is the desired state of the
context for the entity in question. There may or may not be a method whereby the entity in question
(let us call it X for notational simplicity) can evolve the original context to the desired one. In this
case, either a method of evolving the original context (OC) anyway to an approximation of the
desired context (DC) is found in the process, considered satisfactory, and exercised, or else a new
desired context (DC’) is formulated which seems to X less likely to be methodologically
impossible, and the process starts over. The rules of how to choose what to do then become our
‘meta-method,’ so to speak, of extracting a DC from any given OC.
</blockquote>

Now it's my turn to interpret what you believe that I believe. My understanding of your formulation here is that you consider an agent (which you call X) to evaluate the evidence present in his environment and express it in a collection of sentences that describes the current state he finds himself in (which you call OC). The agent then comes up with a state he would *like* to be in, which he describes with a new collection of sentences (which you call DC). At that point, the agent either figures out how to achieve the DC or formulates a new DC that he can in fact realize. You then understand my project of "Getting What You Want" as the "rules" for how to most effectively carry out this process -- the "meta-method" of moving from the OC to the DC, as you put it.

This seems like a fair understanding of my thinking, although I could put it more succinctly: the agent evaluates the world around him and takes the action that places him in the most desirable, achievable future state. I should note that my thinking on this topic comes from a *normative* standpoint: I argue that we *should* behave like this agent, that we should be concerned with optimally evaluating evidence and making decisions so as to approximate the best path of world states as closely as possible.

I also acknowledge (as will become relevant with your critiques below) that the way this actually plays out in the real world may bear little resemblance to the stylized theoretical formulation we've built up here. Of course any real agent -- me, you, our political institutions, etc. -- will not explicitly follow this process, nor have any real way of measuring its performance relative to the illusive optimal path. In fact, the very idea of an optimal path (best sequence of actions) is itself a theoretical construct, since one's values are rarely so coherent that they could be summarized in a stylized maximization problem (this is related to your later complaint about the ill-definedness of the notion of consciousness). I don't intend to provide a detailed rulebook for how to act, or even give an incontrovertible defense that this is even the best way for everyone to think about things; I merely find this way of thinking to be intuitively attractive, and I might characterize the conclusions I draw to be precepts of a mathematically-inspired pseudoreligion more than anything else. Of course, if anyone has access to any Truth or Ethics they can bring to bearing on the matter, I'd be more than happy to hear.

<blockquote>
There seem at once two principles that must be accounted for in formulating this meta-method.
Number one, as you have pointed out, is that desires may be myopic in the temporal axis:
Hedonism is a dangerous gamble for longevity. On the other hand, they may be myopic in the
social axis: Selfishness damages the context for the group while (however momentarily) improving
matters for ourselves. I may draw this temporal and social distinction, but I believe they come to
the same thing: Our meta-method cannot be short-sighted, for myopic morality is paid for in the
karmic coming around.

In other words, it is not prudent enough to formulate our meta-method in a single evolution-step.
Merely asking, “Given this context, what can I do in a single move that maximizes my utility in
the next context” is postponed suicide. It is apparent from what we are saying that we have already
found ourselves in a Darwinian framework, even as I have tried to restrict myself to a merely
physical ontology.
</blockquote>

I don't have much to say here, as I'm on board with these points. I've noted elsewhere that my way of thinking is certainly compatible with altruism. With regard to your point about thinking in terms of a single decision step, it is of course true that an agent needs to take into account how a given action will affect his set of possible actions in the future, but in any case he still has to make a decision now in the context of his current valuation of evidence and of the potential outcomes. I recommend looking into some concepts from dynamic programming (a mainstay of macroeconomics, finance, and a few other fields, if you're not already familiar), particularly the idea of Bellman equation, which give an idea of how to do this, at least in a simple, theoretical setting.

<blockquote>
I, too, see a strong analogy between morality and what I might call ‘the universal motive force.’
To ensure that we are on the same semantic page, I will correspond this statement with a musing
of yours in which you stated that “the universe’s actions are always perfectly in line with its desires,implying that the universe is itself a perfectly moral machine — each time a raindrop falls, a plant
grows, a star shines, a neuron fires, a morally impeccable event is unfolding.” Raindrops fall
according to the properties of their chemical makeup passing through various regions of the
gravitational field, which is dictated by the wondrous morality of quantum gravity; the
gravitational field that Einstein taught is the fabric spacetime itself, the electromagnetic field, the
fields of the elementary particles, they are all beating and fluttering with respect to each other in
classical tempo, a grand and jazzy call and response. Plants grow from the providence of
thermodynamic resources involving every rain drop, every worm, and every mineral ground into
soil by biological digestion. Everything acts in a way to perpetuate its own survival, or else it
ceases to exist. The price of immorality is the immolation of immortality, or so Darwin tells us.
</blockquote>

Ah! This is perfectly quotable! I feel like printing out the last few sentences here and taping them to my wall.

<blockquote>
But even Darwin was not willing to extend this principle to the whole universe. Sure, there are
physical laws and all physical things abide by them. There are biological things and all biological
things are physical things. So far so good. But how do we make sense of ‘desire’ when verbal
consent is not present, as is surely the case where no intermediary language can mediate
communication thus? We have recourse only to take the step that you did, which is to say that
those actions that happen are precisely what the raindrops, plants, stars, and neurons desired in the
first place. How convenient.

I have thought long about making desire stability-based. For instance, I don’t need verbal consent
one way or the other to know that the act of murder is not desirable for anyone. Ceasing to exist
ought to be undesirable for any physical system, in some appropriate sense. But even this presents
immediate contradiction: If ceasing to exist is undesirable, and if those systems that cannot
communicate the desires behind their actions all act exactly and impeccably according to their
desire, then why does *anything* ever cease to exist? Why does any raindrop eventually splatter?
Why do electrons decay? Why do hydrogen atoms allow themselves to be fused into helium?
Whence Shiva?

We know, for instance, that the universe itself is dying a slow heat death. Is that because it desires
death? Isn’t this the most short-sighted of moral mishaps? Is the universe so morally impeccable
and yet so damn clumsy in execution? No. The problem is that the universe cannot think of itself
completely. The problem is that the universe is based on a body of law that precludes its own self-
understanding. It is aware of its own being only so far as it is at all. The line between existence
and self-awareness is a flimsy one, as is that between physical and chemical reality, between
chemical and biological reality, and most especially between conscious and unconscious reality. I
deplore the very use of the predicate ‘conscious.’ It is without meaning. Depending on how we
select our semantics it might be true of everything or true of nothing, and if we attempt to define
it so that either of these trivial cases are not so, we find the predicate vague and intensional, and
thus not deserving of the exalted and extensional status of ‘predicate’ at all, and hence certainly
cannot be helpful in any logical inference.
</blockquote>

I should note that it is reasonable not to interpret the analogy between morality and the "universal motive force" as more than just an analogy. I equate the two on some level, mostly due to aesthetic preference, but this is understandably an arguable decision. As a devotee of Spinoza's God, I find this idea useful, but others might not. And I readily admit that the whole idea as thinking of the universe as a conscious entity is quite clumsy -- to be honest, the idea of consciousness in the first place is one with very rough edges -- so talking about collective consciousness and universal consciousness leans more toward poetry than toward rigorous philosophy. What I want to do is note the analogy between natural law and our concepts about moral law and ask myself, "Where does it lead me if I call them the same thing?"

On the other hand, I am not personally a fan of equating survival with morality. It is, of course, useful at times to think in this way, but I personally find it a bit clumsy to assume that the moral imperative of everything is to simply continue existing. What is bad about ceasing to exist, except that individual agents may want to keep existing? Is it a failure to follow the universe's lead and someday choose to make oneself disperse? Somewhat in line with what you've written, I will happily argue that we ought, collectively, to prioritize more attention to the question of how to achieve more control over our lifespans, but that doesn't mean that it is always in one's interest to keep existing. And of course, on the universal level, I'm not sure I can think of a real objection to the universe deciding that everything must someday fade out.


<blockquote>
I can go a step further and argue that the whole notion of desires are time-dependent. They
recognize a present state of things and anticipate future states. This is bound to fall apart if we
consider the whole universe as moral in this way, since time is not a real physical concept, but
rather an illusory and an emergent one, as modern physics teaches. Time is macroscopically
defined only locally with respect to some shared physical event or regularity that can be used to offset the underlying relativity of physics. Any microscopic meaning of time becomes increasingly
meaningless as we approach the Planck scale. The present moment is an illusion, as is the very
notion of past or future, and this directionality emerges only as a result of our incomplete
knowledge. This is precisely what Ludwig Boltzmann realized at the inception of statistical
mechanics, and quantum mechanics has only compounded the problem.
</blockquote>

Good point. The universe *simply is.* It does not anticipate future states because it's already there.

<blockquote>
After such a thoroughgoing attack, you might ask why I ever bothered saying I agree with you in
the first place. As I said, it is not that I disagree with your conclusion. It is only your justification
that I find wanting. Moreover, I am somewhat proud to say, none of my criticism comes from any
strictly deterministic mindset. I am not attempting to deflate free will in arguing as I have. I believe
quantum indeterminacy does supply us with a sense of probability that truly makes reality a laissez
faire domain, so this is not my source of strife. The source of my strife is the introduction of desires
in the first place.

So how do I justify morality on a universal level? An inchoate formulation of my answer is that
reality, as I see it, is simply a genetic interaction of Becoming becoming becomings. The very
individuation of ‘reality’ implicit in its use as a singular term indicates that reality is asking itself
the same question that We are. Reality would like to know how to act in the face of quantum
uncertainty, and it is acting haphazardly in the meantime as it figures it out. Reality is learning,
and so are we. This is morality. Become like reality. Understand what is around us. Reality is not
isolated. There is no such thing. All things are nodes in interactions. Existence itself is only an
idiom useful in the language of Event. I am faith seeking understanding. We are faith seeking
understanding. Reality is a body of faithful devotees seeking understanding.
</blockquote>

I will readily stand with you in saying that the introduction of desires into this makes the whole thing something of a mess. Desires are messy like the messy-minded humans who hold them. (And, of course, trying to plaster the notion of desire onto everything else will be imprecise as well.) My thoughts on this have stemmed mostly from thinking about the rampant use of utilitarian thinking in economics and the difficulty of fundamentally justifying those ideas or using them to think about the well-being of populations. If there was some way of leaving behind human-centric notions like "desire" in favor of some more fundamental concept, I'd be happy to know it -- so I'm interested to know where your inchoate formulation takes you. I'm not sure what it means for Becoming to become becomings, but I suppose until you can flesh that out for me I'll find beauty in your declaration: "Reality is a body of faithful devotees seeking understanding."
