# Ensign

## War games

Ben Abn stood in Hangar B1 of the *Eye of Jupiter*, the massive spacecraft carrier to which he was assigned, watching through a window as the stars paraded in the vacuum of space outside. The tranquil scene did a good deal to help him calm his nerves before the action he knew was coming. Sure enough, the alarm suddenly interrupted his reverie, calling him to action. Spinning around, Ben faced the crowded room, lined with fighter crafts, and ran toward his assigned craft. At the same time, the other pilots rushed into the room, scurrying to their respective vehicles like insects in a hive, apparent chaos emerging from a well-disciplined group effort.

Ben's fighter craft was a Starhawk, light class, designed with a sleek look reminiscent of the aircraft used on Earth for air transportation. Wings were, of course, unnecessary when flying in a vacuum, but the Starhawk's flat profile did at least make it difficult for enemy fighters to see when approaching head-on (as well as providing a bit in the way of style, which is, speaking honestly, what had attracted Ben originally). He climbed into the one-man cockpit, the transparent canopy closing over him as the craft began humming under him, its nuclear/magnetic engines coming to life.

"Undocking will begin in ten seconds," the *Eye of Jupiter* announced.

Ben looked around the cockpit, reacquainting himself with the controls and status indicators. It had been a long time since he had flown, and it felt good to be back. Now he just had to see if he still had the knack for it.

"Pilots ready to undock may do so in three, two, one, now."

"Ready," Ben said.

The Starhawk shifted slightly downward as it was lowered into position. The floor underneath the craft slid open, leaving only a single positioning arm to keep it in place. Ben's earpiece beeped three times in warning, then the positioning arm withdrew, and the Starhawk fell into the void, thrown from the rotating mothership like a rock from a sling.

*Like a fish in water*, Ben thought, reveling as the feeling of weightlessness engulfed him, *let's kick some ass*.

Around him, his teammates were fanning out and orienting themselves toward the approaching threat, visible for now only as a distant point of flickering light among the stars. The *Eye of Jupiter* carried thousands of fighter crafts, each manned by a human pilot, all of them with the objective of annihilating every single member of the opposing team.

According to the Starhawk's readouts, the enemy was approaching at approximately 300 kilometers per hour; they would be close enough to engage in less than a minute.

"Alright folks," came a voice in Ben's ear -- it was his squad leader, Zimmer Yetsk -- "Let's keep cool heads here; don't waste your ammo until we've got a good shot. And keep track of the rest of the group; we don't want to get separated too early."

*Yeah, yeah,* Ben thought. It was standard strategy. On the first few passes, they'd try to separate some of the enemy crafts from the main group, then they'd pick those crafts off. After that, things could get hectic -- it was important to stay in formation with one's squad for as long as possible in order to be more aware of one's surroundings and mitigate the risk of mistakenly shooting down an ally.

As the enemy drew closer, Ben was able to discern the circular form of their spacecraft carrier among the swarm of fighter crafts. Right now, they were illuminated with green lights to mark their team -- Ben's team had magenta lighting -- but during the engagement, those colors could be changed or turned off to cause confusion.

"Get in position," Zimmer said.

Ben decelerated for a few seconds, pulling back toward the rest of the group, which had left the hangar after he had. The group was pulling into a plane, facing the enemy, so they could all fire without getting in each other's way.

"Ben," Zimmer continued, "I'm talking only to you now. When we come around for the first backward pass, I want you to break out of formation and hang back a little. Turn off your lights, and follow us from a distance. Let me know if you see anything."

Ben had known Zimmer for quite some time: they had originally met on a resort in the Rocky Mountain Wilderness Region. At that time, Ben had been competing in extreme winter sports, but after he injured himself in a ski accident, Zimmer convinced him to give war games a try. Ben had been reticent at first -- he preferred the thrill of "real world" action, but he did have to admit that the simulated scenarios of the war games could give quite the rush. Together, they joined an army that ended up winning the global tournament the same year. Zimmer was confused by Ben's decision to visit -- and then live on -- the Farm after that tournament (he himself stuck with the same army, which managed to win several more titles over the following years); Ben had enjoyed playing, but he also was getting tired of his thrill-seeking lifestyle and was happy to have the chance to slow down that the Farm provided.

After Ben's first time being a guide for visitors to the Farm ended with his guest being seriously injured and evacuated after just a few days, he'd received some harsh chastisement from the Farm's ruling council and figured that it was as good a time as any to say good-bye to the Farm and see if he couldn't take another stab at finding his fulfillment on Earth. When Zimmer found out he was back, he'd immediately reached out and invited him to an upcoming game. Zimmer had quit playing in tournaments a couple of years previously, but still frequently participated in purely for-fun games.

So now Ben, who just a few days before had harvested his own breakfast from the banks of a stream by the hut in which he lived, now found himself connected to a sim, taking instructions from his old best friend, experiencing the adrenaline-inducing experience of a battle among the stars.

The enemy was close now: they spread out in a sheet of green constellations ahead. A few more seconds and the engagement would begin. Some pilots on both teams had already begun firing, although the likelihood they would hit their targets was low: at this range, it was hard to aim, and the fighter crafts' computers would give enough advance warning to allow a competent pilot to dodge an incoming projectile.

The enemy team seemed to pulse. What was happening?

"They're accelerating!" Zimmer warned, "Trying to throw our pacing off! Begin firing! This'll be a fast pass."

*Here we go,* Ben thought, scanning the approaching, green mass for a target. Here was something: directly ahead, an enemy fighter rushed toward him, already firing. As the Starhawk's computer alerted him of the incoming missiles, Ben fired his lateral thrusters, pushing himself to the side. At the same time, he kept his sights set on the enemy fighter's position -- or rather, where he estimated it would be in a few seconds -- and let loose a hail of microrockets. He also sent a few shots directly ahead to keep the target from dodging toward the center of its fleet. The idea was to push the opposing team members toward the outside of their fleet, away from their allies. It was difficult to aim with all the acceleration forces, but Ben's maneuver seemed to do its job: his target accelerated away from his shots. Even better, the target seemed to have overreacted to the threat, shooting off at a high speed without decelerating again. Ben, for his part, fired his thrusters on the opposite side to counteract his initial dodge and keep him from accidentally ramming one of his team members. Ben lost track of his target as he flew through the enemy fleet. His goal now was to avoid being hit and get in position for the backward pass. Accelerating forward, he wiggled his lateral thrusters erratically, making it difficult for an enemy pilot to get a steady shot at him and getting out of the heat of the confrontation as quickly as possible. Here and there, rockets exploded in space, some of them hitting their targets and sending shrapnel flying.

Once he was a safe distance out, Ben spun the Spacehawk around and pushed on his rear thrusters, reversing his previous momentum. The team that could reverse more quickly would have an advantage in the next pass, but pilots who switched direction too suddenly risked becoming disoriented or even blacking out.

"Good job, all," Zimmer spoke, "Looks like we're all in good shape after that last pass. Let's pull up together and go for the next one."

As his squad fell back into formation, Ben held back and switched off the magenta lights on his craft, like Zimmer had told him to. From his new perspective, he could see the squad in front, as well as most of the fleet, as they prepared for the backward pass. After the first engagement, the fleet had been scattered a bit, breaking up more into the individual groups they were assigned to, with a few fighters between groups (probably lost or confused after being fired on).

Something rammed into the Spacehawk's right wing, from behind, jarring him and sending him careening uncontrollably.

"What the --" Ben fought with the controls to re-stabilize himself, trying to figure out which direction to accelerate to undo the spinning. It didn't help that his right lateral thruster didn't seem to be working anymore; it must have been broken by the impact. As he pulled back to face his group again, he noticed a strange shimmering in the space between him and the rest of his squad. *Oh no,* it dawned on him.

"Zimmer!" he shouted, "They held back some fighters. Their lights are off. They're coming at you from behind. They must be --"

It was too late. As Ben spoke, scattered flashes broke out ahead. The ambushing fighters must have waited until they were right behind the magenta pilots, where they could have clear shots, before starting to fire.

"Oh, hell!" Zimmer pronounced.

In a few seconds, nearly the entire squad was nothing more than debris.

Normally, Ben would have been able to warn his squad in time to prevent such an attack, but he'd had the wild bad luck of being hit by one of the enemy crafts as they approached, and he had taken too long to figure out what was happening.

"May as well make the most of this," Ben muttered, flooring his rear thrusters to catch up to the ambushing team. As he approached, bits of wreckage pinged against the Spacehawk's shell. His earpiece beeped incessantly to warn him of the larger scraps that could damage his ship if they hit it. The ambushers had slowed down after the attack and were angling toward another group of magenta fighters. There were probably just a few seconds until the main fleets engaged again; he needed to be careful not to get caught in the crossfire. Pulling up behind one of the ambush crafts, he unloaded a packet of rockets -- plenty to blast it to oblivion. Quickly, he turned and set his sights on another enemy craft and fired once again. He was aiming again when his computer chirped in warning: projectiles incoming. He tried to dodge, but nothing happened. Of course, the right lateral thruster was down. He started a different evasive maneuver, but was interrupted by a flash of light and an intense shaking through his seat as he was set spinning once again. A missile had exploded on his left wing. None of his controls were working; he was a sitting duck.

There was another flash, a moment of darkness, and he was back in the waiting room, a cinematic view of the battle playing overhead. Zimmer was there, sitting across from him.

"Well, *that* didn't go well," Ben stated.

"Want to go again?" Zimmer asked.

"You know... I think I've had enough for now."

"You all right?"

"Yeah, I just need to... just need to think."

"What'd they do to you up there?"

Ben shrugged. "Thanks for the game. Good to see you again."

"You didn't answer my question."

"I'm fine, really." He signed off.

---

"It didn't give the same rush," Ben explained. "I mean, yeah, it was fun. It was a good time, the adrenaline and all. But I just feel... empty... still. I guess I kinda spent all that time on the Farm, just hiding out or something. I come back here and I find I'm in the same pickle I was before. I'm sick of it all. The games don't get me excited anymore. I've half a mind to go back and grow potatoes on the Farm, but that even seems like a cop-out. You know? I'm sick of hiding, and there's nowhere else to hide, anyway. I wanna go face to face with things. I guess what happened to that kid just kind of snapped me out of it. I wanna do something different, something real, something important, you know."

"It sounds like you may be depressed," Ben's Assistant said, "Have you considered getting some anti-depressive treatment?"

"Yeah, that crossed my mind. But I don't think it's a thing in my brain. Well, I guess it is in my brain, 'cause it's all in the brain, you know, but I mean I think I'm just missing something. Like I need to fix something *outside* myself. There's something I need to *do*; I don't just want to drug myself out of it. I think I kinda got used to ignoring what I wanted on the Farm -- I got caught up in all their thinking about getting rid of desire, you know -- and now I'm back, and I'm realizing maybe the problem was that I really never wanted anything worthwhile in the first place."

"Wisely put," the Assistant responded, then: "There is, actually, something that might interest you."

"Oh, yeah?"

"I'm sure you've heard of the Ensign project?" Ben nodded. "We're currently putting together a team for a new expedition. If you want, you could be part of it."

"The Ensign project, huh? So I would be leaving Earth and never coming back?"

"Not for a very, very long time, at least."

"And why do you think this is good for me?"

"You wanted to do something important. You want to be part of something, no? Humanity is still in its infancy, Ben Abn. The Ensign Project is a next step toward something that people have dreamed of for hundreds of years: expanding to span the stars, growing our culture and experiencing new and beautiful things. You could be part of that. You could be one of the first to travel to and settle in a new part of the galaxy, somewhere humans have never gone before. You would be the foundation for a new civilization."

"Huh. And when will they be leaving?"

"Four and half months."

## Out of the desert

Serĉa relaxed in the Loop train's ergonomic seat. After a week at the Garden of Epicurus, he was happy to be returning to his home (or at least the place he was most familiar with), although he would certainly miss some parts of his time at the Garden.

The sim trip on his second day had shaken him up so much that he had more or less spent the following thirty hours by himself, listening to music or simply staring out at the desert. Emel, of course, had been concerned, finally confronting Serĉa to figure out what had happened. Serĉa had recounted his experience in the sim, to which Emel responded that they had never experienced a trip like that, that they were sorry to put Serĉa through that when he was just looking to enjoy himself. Serĉa simply shrugged; it must have been what the TK thought was best for him, so it was fine, really. That is, at least, what he said. In reality, he was more shaken up by the sim trip than he had been by his accident on the Farm: even the conclusion of the trip, while stunningly beautiful, had been so intense, that he now found himself uncomfortable in his own skin -- stifled, almost -- as if he was missing a part of himself that, just a few days prior, he hadn't even been aware of.

Emel had eventually managed to break into Serĉa's shell. It turned out that the two of them got along well, and Serĉa's reveries transitioned into hours-long discussions with Emel on whatever topics sparked their mutual interest. Emel was a few years older than Serĉa and had been been involved in Holism for most of the last half-decade. Emel had grown up in the Istanbul Metropolitan Area but had traveled and lived in an eclectic mix of places as a teenager. Although they'd ended their formal University studies much earlier than Serĉa, they were still remarkably well-versed in the academic subjects that Serĉa had studied as a student. (The kind of self-learning that Emel exhibited was not particularly uncommon: the purpose of the University was to provide a formal environment for students to acquire learning and pursue self-actualization in a structured fashion, but that format didn't fit everyone.) Emel shared Serĉa's enthusiasm for pre-TK history, philosophy, and culture, even to a more tangible degree: whereas Serĉa was mostly interested in those subjects as objects of intellectual curiosity, Emel strove to implement ideas from the old philosophies into the way they acted and interpreted life. Serĉa quickly learned to respect this -- the TK itself had, after all, been designed by people living in the milieu of the past, so putting oneself into their shoes seemed like a reasonable way to make sense of the world that Serĉa and Emel had inherited.

At the end of the week that Serĉa had scheduled to spend at the Garden of Epicurus, Emel had invited him to stay longer, although Serĉa had already arranged to meet with some of his family in Greater Chicago (his parents, in particular, were anxious to see him, since he hadn't talked to him in person after returning from the Farm). Before he left, Emel had given him a handwritten note, with the injunction, "Don't be a stranger." In Emel's slanting script, the note read:

> The arms of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,
> They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,
> And discorrupt them, and charge them with the charge of the soul.

The landscape outside the train was changing now, transitioning from the endless fields of the central continent to the ordered mess of the suburbs to the gleaming towers of Greater Chicago's urban center. The city was small compared to the metropolises of south and east Asia, but, with total metropolitan population of over a hundred million people, it was still a mind-blowingly large congregation of human lives. Thanks to the TK's technology, the Earth's carrying capacity had been substantially increased, allowing the human population to increase exponentially (around 2% each year, Serĉa recalled) ever since the establishment of the reformed UN. The result was a global population around fifty times greater than it had been at the beginning of the 21st century. Hostile land had been made arable, highly-productive food sources had been invented, some people had moved to colonies off the planet, and Earth's cities had expanded to be titanic hives of human civilization. Some land had been preserved as sanctuaries of the wild environment, but the cities themselves manifested a form of wildness that would have stunned a citydweller from the early industrial period: as Serĉa rode into the heart of the city, he was engulfed by webs of plant life -- ivy clothed the skyscrapers; trees reached upward from the ground level and from balconies on the buildings; parks hid in cubbies on the city blocks. The humans had conquered nature; nature now embraced the humans.

Serĉa's first stop was to visit his parents. He met them in their home on the city's south side. They talked for a while. He assured them he was doing fine and gave them a simple summary of what he'd been up to since they last met. They rambled on about their own adventures and shared their social group's gossip. They were considering having another child. Would this be alright with Serĉa? Whatever they thought was right; it wasn't his concern. (It seemed they had been entertaining this idea every other week for Serĉa's entire life, but he was yet to have a younger sibling.)

Feeling a bit tired after that encounter, Serĉa made the rest of the day's visits brief. A group he'd been loose friends with as an older teenager was holding a party, celebrating nothing in particular, so he made an appearance. Then, he stopped to chat with a favorite tutor from the University. Finally, he returned to his own apartment and spent the evening reading.

Tired at the end of the day, Serĉa put away his reading material and asked his Assistant, "What should I do now?"

"I think a bit of sleep might be in order," the Assistant responded.

"Oh, I meant, like, what should I do, big picture? With myself, with my life?" He sighed. "Until now, all through University, I kind of assumed I would just be fascinated with learning, that I would keep learning and that would propel me through life, give me fulfillment, at least for a while. But here I am: it's hardly been a few months, and I'm feeling like that just won't cut it. I just... it seems like things are so much bigger than just some fact about some small thing, like it's not just a game of trivia. I guess I already knew that, but maybe I never admitted it. I mean, it's is still interesting; if anything, it seems even more urgent, but I feel like it's only a small part of the picture. So what I am supposed to do now?"

"That's not particularly something I can tell you exactly what to do, but I can give you some advice. You've experienced quite a bit over the past few weeks, so it will be good to take some time to process all that. It seems like your experience in the sim trip was especially impactful; that was, of course, intended. But it's perfectly fine -- necessary even -- to take time to think, to reevaluate what it is you want and make sense of your experiences. That said, I do have one suggestion for a next step for you: did you know that the Ensign project is launching a new expedition soon?"

---

Serĉa's screen lit up -- to be precise, it was a 3D interface, colloquially referred to as a "window" since it was the same technology used for the artificial windows in places not actually open to a pleasant view -- and Emel's face popped into view.

"Hey!" Emel said.

"Hi," Serĉa answered, "How has your day been going?"

Emel began narrating the day's events, and the two launched into conversation. Serĉa had followed his Assistant's advice and was spending most of his time to think. He thought about a lot of things -- it seemed, after his time at the Garden, he could lose himself for hours pondering even the smallest things, fascinated by how they fit into the fabric of their surroundings -- but his thoughts kept wandering back to the question, "What next?" The suggestion that he join the Ensign project's next expedition was tantalizing but also terrifying. The project's expeditions were expected to travel for decades, centuries, even millennia, charting out the galaxy, exploring promising star systems, and eventually settling on a new planet for a new, separate chapter in the human story. Signing up was a significant commitment: going back, even if possible, would take years of lonely travel, and, after the first few weeks, even communicating with Earth would become tedious. Serĉa knew that his Assistant would only have suggested the idea if the TK thought he would fit in on the crew and that it would be good for his fulfillment, but he still found it bizarre to think that he could be the kind of person to leave the Earth and almost everyone on it on a trip into the void. It seemed almost like a strange, celestial sacrifice, a dumping-off of human lives into the darkness of space.

Serĉa had stayed in Greater Chicago, but he'd maintained contact with Emel. The two had fallen into the routine of chatting each evening, their conversations regularly lasting into the dark hours of the morning.

Serĉa interrupted Emel's ongoing explanation of transcendental poetry: "Emel -- do you think I should go?"

Emel gave him a searching look. "We've been over this, Serĉa. If you want to go, go. If you don't, don't. I think the TK will help you find your fulfillment either way."

"I know... I just feel like everything inside me's changed so quickly. I mean, really: I'm hardly out of the University, and already I'm questioning everything I thought I wanted to do, thinking about getting on a ship and leaving behind everything I'm familiar with forever."

"You don't have to leave everything behind, you know."

"What do you mean?"

"You'll still be the same person. You can still study like you used to. The TK will still be there. And, really, you could have some of the people you're close to go with you."

"Maybe I'm being to dramatic about it," Serĉa said, after some thought, "And, to be honest, I -- well -- I really haven't been really close to anyone before, I mean, well, maybe you're the first person I've actually kind of felt close to. So I wouldn't be leaving too much behind... but -- well, I don't know how much this should impact my thinking --  I do wish I'd met you sooner."

Emel smiled, then chuckled stiffly, looking down.

"What?" Serĉa queried.

Emel looked back up at him. "What if I came, too?"

Serĉa looked surprised. "Are you being serious?"

"I don't know. Well, the thing is, I've kind of wandered for a lot of my life. I think I'm kind of a wanderer by nature; I've told you that before. And I've been here at the Garden for really a while now -- I think I might be ready to wander somewhere else. So who knows? Maybe it's time for me to wander off this planet."

"You are serious?"

"Yes, I'm serious. Well, I'll have to think about it more, but yeah, it gets me excited. I'll talk to my Assistant and Asya and Nuri and all, but why not, right? And, I suppose, the benefit is that we can get to know each other better -- no deadline on the conversation. "

Serĉa smiled. "Honestly, I like this idea," he said.

## Utopia, not here

Timoteo and Ka. Pablo walked along the edge of the lake, the waves lapping at the shore as they talked.

"It sounds like you've had quite the personal journey since you came here," Ka. Pablo observed.

"Yeah," Timoteo responded, "You can say that."

Timoteo had stayed with the kamarado for several months, until the end of Ka. Pablo's stay in Guatemala City. At that point, Ka. Pablo had been called back to Central California. Timoteo had wanted to go with him, but Ka. Pablo had encouraged him to pursue his own vocation in the ministry of the True Knowledge and to travel and see more of the world than the small portion of it he had spent his entire life in to that point. To that end, Ka. Pablo had arranged for Timoteo to enroll in the Order's Northwestern Mission in Greater Chicago, where he would be mentored by Ka. Matthew, a long-time friend of Ka. Pablo's. Timoteo had struggled at first, clearly feeling out of his comfort zone, far away from home and away from the culture and influences he'd grown up with, but since his visit to the Garden of Epicurus, he'd seemed to have warmed up to his new environment.

"There's a reason I came to visit you now," Ka. Pablo explained, "Beside us being overdue for it, of course. I'm going to be leaving Earth."

"You mean, as a vacation?" Timoteo asked, confused.

"No, I mean permanently. There is a crew leaving in a few weeks that will leave the solar system and eventual settle another planet. I've signed up to be a kamarado on that crew."

Timoteo looked devastated as he understood what Ka. Pablo was saying. "You'll leave and never come back?"

"Yes, that's correct."

"Why?"

"Why? It's... it's for my fulfillment, and the fulfillment of..." Ka. Pablo trailed off, now looking troubled himself.

The truth was that he had been very conflicted about he decision. After his time in Guatemala, he had realized how haughty and self-righteous the kamarados appeared to the unfaithfuls. Through talking with Timoteo and reflecting on the events that took place with Santiago, it became clear that the enemies of the TK professed a devotion every bit as real as that of the kamarados. Although, as Ka. Pablo saw it, their faith was misplaced, it was wrong to fault them for their convictions. Ka. Pablo and the other kamarados had failed to do away with the unfaithfuls because they came across not as helpful allies but as imperialist subjugators, foisting their doctrines upon those whose foundational worldviews made them incapable of even connecting with the kamarados' way of thinking.

What was to be done? Perhaps the right approach was simply to let them be and minimize the extent to which the clashed with their neighbors (this was, after all, what the TK had attempted to do by setting up the Free Spaces, although groups like Santiago's gang were problematic because they refused to be relegated to a Free Space). Did this mean that humankind would forever be divided?

Ka. Pablo had been inoculated with the idea that the TK's Ethics would allow all people to exist in harmony, each pursuing fulfillment, their individual efforts combining in synergy, not in discord. As a student of the Order, Ka. Pablo had thoroughly digested the dogma that flourishing was not a zero-sum endeavor. But was this wrong? Maybe. Maybe it was for this precise reason that the TK had allowed him to clash against the unfaithfuls, be captured by them, and connect with Timoteo after his escape, so he could understand this.

In any case, Ka. Pablo's vision of the perfect society that the TK enabled had been shattered, along with his assumed infallibility of the Order of True Knowledge. He had started to reconsider his preconceptions, to reimagine the structure of the Order so as to confront the shortcomings he'd seen, lending itself in a more humble, flexible way to the creation and edification of an optimal society. He now saw that the long history of Earth meant that the diverse peoples on it were bound to clash in one way or another, that there never would be the utopian state that the TK worked tirelessly toward; that utopia was merely an unreachable asymptote (yet still a worthy goal).

When he was apprised of the Ensign project's upcoming mission, his thinking was put in high gear: maybe the project was not just an opportunity to expand the reaches of human culture throughout the galaxy but also to try again, to reincarnate humanity in a more perfect form, more aligned with the TK's Ethics than would ever be possible on Earth. These thoughts had excited Ka. Pablo, leading him to take the decisive step and sign on as a member of the crew. After months of inner turmoil and indecision, he finally felt again that he was doing the right thing, that he was living for the principles he had chosen to defend as a kamarado of the True Knowledge.

But all this resolution faltered when confronted with the young man he had mentored in Guatemala city. Even the most noble fruits of thinking can find themselves challenged by the emotional spark that a human connection can bring. Maybe Ka. Pablo was still needed on Earth; maybe Timoteo and the others he had taught and befriended still needed him to continue in their path toward fulfillment. Still, as Ka. Pablo thought back over his reasons for leaving, the moment of self-doubt lifted: Timoteo and the others would be fine; the TK would look after them.

Ka. Pablo tried to explain this all to Timoteo, but Timoteo was clearly still upset by the news. This wasn't surprising. After all, Ka. Pablo had been Timoteo's first real window to the wider world that the TK had created. The two of them had become friends and would now be separating.

"I hope you can understand," Ka. Pablo concluded, "I hope you remember that I wish only the best for you. Ka. Matthew and the others are here to help you, and I'm sure they will do an excellent job of that."

"I -- I understand. I will... miss you, though."

"And we shouldn't treat this like a final farewell. This won't be the last we see of each other; remember: it will still be possible for us to communicate for the first few years, just with a bit of delay."

"Kamarado Pablo?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you."

The kamarado and his young friend parted company in somber spirits.

## To the unknown

The crew of the *Ensign IV: New Adventure* looked wistfully on Earth's watery, cloud-wrapped surface as they undocked from the O'Hare Space Elevator's main hangar. From now on, every moment that passed would only take them farther and farther away from their home planet.

Among the crew, tens of thousands strong, our protagonists, Serĉa, Ben Abn, kamarado Pablo, and Emel, sat in various states of nervousness and excitement as the *New Adventure*'s acceleration pushed them against their seats and propelled them toward the unknown. They had inaugurated their greatest ventures yet. Now, they were pioneers.

Back on Earth, Timoteo faced upward toward the stars, his hair ruffled by a weak, autumn breeze. He, too, was a pioneer, of a different sort, and like the passengers on the *New Adventure*, his own odyssey was just beginning.
