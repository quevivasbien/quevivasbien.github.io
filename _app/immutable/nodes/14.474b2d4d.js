    the personal level — how do the various voices within one’s own head combine
    to give an experience of conscious identity? This same difficulty has been noted
    by economic theorists in their preference- and utility-based model. On the individual

    or preferences that change significantly over time (although

    is very similar to the general approach used in microeconomic theory, where

    of well-being to every possible collection of resources and circumstances a person
    may have. A basket of goods is associated with a higher value of a given person’s
    utility function if and only if that person’s well-being is higher with that
    basket of goods. This mathematical formalization of preferences is used to quantitatively
    describe the ways in which people interact and form markets to exchange goods

    to maximize their utilities give rise to a system of prices and exchange of
    goods, but it is quite another thing to take these ideas and use them to say
    something about how the states of well-being of the people comprising a
    social group are related to the collective well-being of the society that
    they constitute. One idea I have proposed as a way of thinking about this is
    to take the natural extension of the desire satisfaction model and assert
    that `),F=s(k,"A",{href:!0});var vo=r(F);ri=o(vo,`social groups should act in such a way as to achieve the “desires”

    (i.e. the ideas expressed via conversation within the group) — that is, to assume
    that the collective well-being of a social group is increased by pursuing actions
    that place the group more in line with the desires expressed by the combined
    voices of the group, with the converse also being true. The difficulty is, of
    course, figuring out how exactly the disparate expressed opinions of a group
    combine to form a collective voice, but this is of course also a difficulty on
    the personal level — how do the various voices within one’s own head combine
    to give an experience of conscious identity? This same difficulty has been noted
    by economic theorists in their preference- and utility-based model. On the individual
    level, the standard economic model does not allow for a person holding contradictory
    or otherwise inconsistent preferences, simultaneous sets of distinct preferences,
    or preferences that change significantly over time (although
    `),V=s(k,"A",{href:!0});var bo=r(V);hi=o(bo,"I have tried to address some of those problems"),bo.forEach(i),ci=o(k,`
    in my own thinking). On the collective level, economic thinkers have gone so

    a bit less bleak if the assumptions involved are relaxed a bit (and the
    literature surrounding this problem is
    `),K=s(k,"A",{href:!0});var _o=r(K);pi=o(_o,"really quite interesting"),_o.forEach(i),yi=o(k,`), but the fact remains that the way in which individual preferences/states
    of well-being should be agglomerated is far from obvious. Even so, I think
    it is still in many cases reasonable to make some basic assertions about
    what social groups want and what they should do to move toward those wants.
