This means thousands of thousands of thousands of people freed from short lives most likely filled with constant hunger, disease, and general discomfort. It is true that capitalism rewards some people more than others -- allowing for significant inequality in wealth, especially when returns to capital outpace returns to labor as we are seeing right now -- and that this is an issue that we should be paying attention to; however, it does not automatically follow that someone is a morally reprehensible person simply because he or she possesses enormous wealth nor that their wealth interferes with your personal flourishing. In fact, I see ultra-wealthy philanthropists like Bill and Melinda Gates as filling an important role in funding effective charitable endeavors served better by private donors than the unwieldy hand of public spending.
