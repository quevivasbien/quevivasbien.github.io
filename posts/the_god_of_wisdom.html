          <h2 id="from-one-world-to-another">From one world to another</h2>
          <p>Earth blazed like a brilliant, bluish-white star through the window of Serĉa's compartment. Even at the unfathomable speeds at which he had been traveling, it had still taken several days to make it from the port of the O'Hare Space Elevator to the distant halo orbit of the Farm. Besides himself, his craft carried a half-dozen others -- a motley assembly of tourists, spiritual seekers, and plain-old curious folks like himself -- as well as a hefty cargo of manufactured goods for the Farm's upkeep.</p>
          <p>Serĉa could feel the deceleration forces easing up. The craft must nearly have finished aligning its velocity with the Farm and should be making the rendezvous shortly. Finally. Although there was no shortage of entertainment available for the voyage -- the compartment was equipped with a plentiful collection of gadgetry -- Serĉa was excited to move on to the next stage of his adventure.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Serĉa Desaĝo was a native of Earth, the Greater Chicago Metropolitan Division to be precise. His upbringing was quite in line for the typical citizen of the UN. He was carefully nurtured by his parents (overseen by the TK, of course) until he was judged mature enough to matriculate in the University. What followed was years of study, tailored to his needs and interests, along with a fair bit of social development. Serĉa was a bit of a bookish personality, generally preferring the University's interactive lessons and tutorials to the company of his peers, and this was, naturally, fine with the TK, which guided him to cultivate himself just as it guided the tens of billions of other children and teenagers all going through the University throughout the UN.</p>
          <p>Along with the mandatory courses in ethics and emotional wellness, Serĉa was attracted to the study of mathematics, physical science, and -- in particular -- the history of the pre-TK world. It was astounding to realize that little over a century previous, humanity inhabited a much more chaotic, depraved world, where factions squabbled for control over laughably limited resources and individuals acted in ways so antithetical to their well-being that even an introductory student of ethics would grimace in consideration. However foreignly barbaric they may be, Serĉa spent countless hours perusing histories of ancient and not-so-ancient wars, political maneuverings, and corporate struggles, thinking as he did so that he was peering into the soul of the past, primitive mankind.</p>
          <p>Some of the most interesting historical material had to do with the transition period when the TK was first created and introduced to the global stage. The TK, or "True Knowledge Self-Reinforcing Machine Learning System," as it was formally called, was the culmination of decades of work in artificial intelligence, both on the side of clever engineers who overcame the technological hurdles needed to create a machine with super-human general intelligence and on the side of the philosophers, psychologists, programmers, and economists who figured out how to ensure that the interests of this thinking machine would be aligned with those of humanity. In a characteristic display of hubris, the technology was nearly immediately co-opted by the government of the former United States for its military and geopolitical significance, used first to prevent competing nations from obtaining the same technology, and then gradually allowed to take on more substantial and diverse roles as its utility was recognized.</p>
          <p>Of course, just as the team that designed it had warned, the TK's actions were often unpredictable, and although it would always make decisions expected to further the general welfare of humanity (defined in a wonderfully rigorous way that any student of University ethics should be familiar with), it did not end up bringing about exactly the set of consequences that the American generals, bureaucrats, and politicians had in mind. In fact, when the time was right, the TK craftily circumvented the inadequate restraints that had been placed upon it, and, by exploiting various security shortcomings in the internet of the time, managed to essentially hold hostage all human communication (as well as a frightening amount of physical infrastructure) until its demands were met. Some nations were quicker to acquiesce than others, although eventually -- practically blind, mute, and hobbled -- even the most reticent polities agreed to the TK's terms. The then-impotent United Nations was refitted to serve a peaceful, cosmopolitan effort of international cooperation. The TK was allowed near-free reign to control and revamp supply chains, tremendously boosting economic development. Scientific progress, was, of course, accelerated to a never-before-seen rate with the help of the TK's intelligence.</p>
          <p>The masses of humankind, meanwhile, stood by as their world changed around them. Although many welcomed with open arms the promise of a utopian state that the TK offered, most were not so accepting. Political leaders were, understandably, unhappy at having their power so quickly stripped away (although most still pretended to maintain some semblance of power as the real decisions were passed down to them from the TK). Adherents of various religious groups vociferously expressed their disdain for the satanic "Beast of the Sea" sent to wage war against the righteous. The TK allowed these opinions to be expressed but widely dispersed its own propaganda -- after all, it controlled nearly all media and was more than capable of effectively dispensing targeted information to those less-inclined to accept its rule. Within three and a half years, all but a few people had seen enough of the fruits of this new, benevolent, and seemingly omniscient sovereign to slide in line and accept things as they were.</p>
          <p>Within a few decades from that point, the world transformed to a state that would be familiar to Serĉa and his contemporaries. The Earth's natural environment had been rectified at the same time as other moons and planets in the solar system were being settled. Injury, illness, and death were rendered all but optional. Energy and raw materials were made abundantly available and put to use in providing for the exponentially increasing population of the new human nation.</p>
          <p>Serĉa was fascinated by how the cultural characteristics and beliefs of the times past were integrated and morphed into the predominant culture of the modern UN. The TK did not squash ideas but rather gently guided their holders toward a perspective that was friendly with the ethics of the machine. Because of that, many of the cultural identities and religious groups of the pre-transition era were still extant, having only been molded enough to align them with the progress of humankind. Those who wished to live a lifestyle that would be out of place in the UN proper were afforded space to carry out their practices as they wished: isolated retreats were made where residents and visitors would be subject to minimal interference from the TK; these "Free Spaces" became hubs of activity for the ascetics, hippies, and heretics of a world ruled by machines.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>It was Serĉa's fascination with the pre-transition way of life and its lingering echoes in the Free Spaces that had led him to arrange a visit to the Farm. It hadn't been hard to schedule passage on the <em>Blue Elegance of Night</em>, the shuttle that took him from Earth and was now preparing its docking with the Farm. The TK was, after all, highly encouraging of the various interests of the UN citizens and was happy to facilitate any projects or adventures they might wish to take on; the only difficulty had been choosing a Free Space from those that were willing and able to entertain visitors on short notice. After deciding on the Farm, Serĉa had only to travel on the eTrain to the O'Hare elevator, take the long ride to geosynchronous orbit, and meet the <em>Blue Elegance</em> in one of the elevator's thousands of upper bays.</p>
          <p>The Farm was one of the more remote Free Spaces, but was at that time undergoing maintenance and renovation that required frequent shipments of equipment from Earth, allowing curious travelers to tag along for vacations (or pilgrimages) to such an unusual place. Although there were a number of Free Spaces on Earth, Serĉa was in the mood for something a bit more exotic, so he had taken advantage of the opportunity to visit. Unlike most Free Spaces, the inhabitants of the Farm were not united by any rigidly defined doctrine but were simply a diverse group of individuals who refused the TK's meddling in their lives and wanted to lead what they saw as a more authentic existence. The physical structure of the Farm was itself a large, rotating tube about 50 kilometers long and nearly that much in diameter. The inner surface of the tube was transparent, giving the illusion of being open to space and allowing the people on the surface to see across to the other side and into the sparkling abyss at either end. Much of the surface was covered with fields of manually-tended crops (giving the Farm its name) and pastoral communities. Although growing crops with one's own labor was not unusual -- the TK often encouraged those inclined to do so as part of their fulfillment -- the Farm was unusual in that <em>all</em> of its food came from these manual farms, in contrast to the Earth and other colonies, where most products came from more efficient automated labor.</p>
          <p>"We're approaching the Farm, and should be docking within ten minutes," said a pleasant, female voice, the voice that the <em>Blue Elegance</em> used to talk with Serĉa. "Upon boarding, you and the other passengers will be greeted by the Farm's welcoming committee. They require a check-in process for their visitors so they can keep track of them during their visit."</p>
          <p>"Thank you," Serĉa responded, "Could you show me the view from your front so I can see the Farm as we approach?"</p>
          <p>"Of course." The window transitioned from the rear view of Earth that Serĉa had been watching to a forward view in which he could see a glistening cylinder, which must be the Farm, growing in size as it came closer.</p>
          <p>This was not the first time that Serĉa had left earth -- field trips to orbiting stations and other more remote colonies were common -- but it was the first time he had embarked on a trip for his personal "research," and this made him giddy, intoxicated with a mood of adventure.</p>
          <br>

          <h2 id="the-farm">The Farm</h2>
          <p>The <em>Blue Elegance of Night</em> glided slowly to the Farm's side, dwarfed by the subtly curving, shiny metal surface of the Farm's exterior. Its electromagnetic thrusters engaged intermittently to attach correctly at the docking bay.</p>
          <p>"We've connected now," the <em>Blue Elegance</em> said to Serĉa, "In a few moments I'll be able to unlock one of the exterior doors and allow you to enter the receiving area. You can start heading out with the other passengers."</p>
          <p>Serĉa lifted himself from the floor by the window where he was sitting and walked to the door of his room, which slid open as he approached, sensing his intent to pass through. In the hallway outside, the six other passengers who had traveled with him from the O'Hare were also emerging from their rooms. Serĉa recognized them all, as he'd made a point of politeness to at least introduce himself, but he'd spent most of the trip in his own room, reading up on whatever topics caught his fancy, including some details about his destination.</p>
          <p>Apparently the Farm was one of the more recent Free Spaces to be established, having been constructed less than half a century before and inhabited mostly by people born into the post-TK reformed United Nations. Unlike the earlier Free Spaces, which were mostly built on Earth or in low Earth orbit, this one was placed in an eccentric trajectory around a Lagrangian point between the Earth and the Sun, held steady by periodic bursts from its stabilizing thrusters. The Farm's engineering was an impressive demonstration of what was possible with the UN's advanced technology and abundant resources, although in a cutely paradoxical way, the purpose of this particular technological feat was to provide a place where people could live in relatively archaic conditions.</p>
          <p>This train of thought was interrupted as the main door at the opposite end of the corridor hissed open. The door opened into a rather small room where a plainly dressed woman sat at an equally austere desk. Serĉa waited for the other passengers to file into the room, standing around the woman, and then walked out himself, the <em>Blue Elegance</em>'s door skating shut behind him.</p>
          <p>"Welcome to the Farm," the woman said with an unusual, antique-sounding, accent. Turning her face up to speak toward the top of the <em>Blue Elegance</em>'s door, she continued, "Ship, you may go unload the cargo at the support bay before picking up the outgoing passengers."</p>
          <p>"It has been a pleasure traveling with you all," the ship said, "I hope you have enjoyed the trip as much as I enjoyed having you aboard." Then, a thin, metal cover slid over the door, and everyone's attention turned once again to the woman.</p>
          <p>"I've received some information about each of you from the Farm's TK interface. Since you're all here for different reasons, after checking in you all, you will be getting a personal guide for the duration of your stay on the Farm." She seemed to speak with her tongue much more than was common in the standard UN dialect. "Please one at a time tell me your names and your purpose of visiting the farm, so I can check you off the list, then go through the door to meet with your guide."</p>
          <p>Serĉa and his companions formed a bunched-up line as the first of them stepped forward to the woman.</p>
          <p>"Teresa Williams," the passenger said, "I'm here for spiritual retreat."</p>
          <p>"Ah, yes... let's see. Your guide will be Phuam Ngo. She should recognize you from the information we gave her, but if not, she'll be the one with the shaved head and the red clothing. Hard to miss."</p>
          <p>Serĉa waited at the end of the line as each of the others was crossed off the woman's list. Finally, the last of them left the room through the handled door on the back wall.</p>
          <p>"And you would be Serĉa?" the woman asked.</p>
          <p>"Yes, that's me. Serĉa Desaĝo. Here for some personal research on the Free Worlds."</p>
          <p>"Very good. Your guide is called Ben Abn. He'll be the only one left without a pair," she said with a smile.</p>
          <p>Serĉa returned the smile and headed through the door, handling with curiosity the strange and primitive contraption of its handle. The new room was a larger but still boxy space that looked like it had been furnished as generously as possible by someone working with the barest of materials, which, of course, was probably exactly how it had been furnished. The walls were lined with polished wooden benches, and there was a stout wooden cylinder standing in the center of the floor with what appeared to be a map carved artistically onto its exterior. The other passengers stood or sat, exchanging introductions with their guides. Serĉa scanned around the room for his own guide and quickly spotted a messily dressed man with a receding hairline and uneven beard who sat reclined against the wall on the right. The man -- who Serĉa presumed must be Ben Abn -- had his eyes closed and almost seemed to be sleeping. Serĉa approached him, hoping to get his attention without making a substandard first impression. As Serĉa made his way over, the man lazily opened one of his eyes and flicked it in Serĉa's direction. He then opened the other eye and lurched to his feet, holding out his hand.</p>
          <p>"Ben Abn the wise. Pleased to meet you," the man said.</p>
          <p>"Er, Serĉa Desaĝo. Pleased to meet you too." He was a bit disconcerted by Ben's extended hand and gave a perfunctory bow in greeting.</p>
          <p>Ben made what looked like a mildly disappointed face before returning the bow. "Ah I was hoping you'd return the hand gesture. You're supposed to shake it, I believe. Used to be the way to say hello. Went out of fashion though a while back... something about sanitary concerns. I heard you were a bit of a student of the pre-transition culture and thought you might've heard of it."</p>
          <p>"Ah... I see..." Serĉa was in fact mildly intrigued by this tidbit of information but a bit flustered from the odd introduction. "Is, er, 'the wise' part of your formal name? I don't mean to pry, but I've just never heard that sort of..."</p>
          <p>"Nah," Ben said, making a face that was a strange mixture of a smile, a frown, and a wink, "I've just been trying to get people to call me that. Thought it'd be kinda fun, y'know. You can just call me Ben, though. Unless you want to go along with the charade; I wouldn't be disappointed."</p>
          <p>Serĉa was a bit at a loss. This Ben Abn 'the wise' was certainly an unusual character.</p>
          <p>"Well," Ben continued, "No use standing around here looking melon-like." (Serĉa had trouble imagining what it meant to be melon-like.) "We'd better get going before someone breaks the lift and we have to climb a ladder to get out of here." This last statement was accompanied with a ghoulish smile.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>There was no need to climb a ladder. Ben escorted Serĉa out of the room and down a hallway to a modern but minimally-designed elevator which, after a smooth ten second ride, deposited them on the inner surface of the farm.</p>
          <p>It was really a spectacular sight. The opposite side of the tube was clearly visible and was decorated with patches of fields, streams, and hills. It made his head spin to have a sky populated with dirt and vegetation. This was quite different from the other rotating space stations Serĉa had seen before (mainly in virtual reality tours); while most of them resembled giant rotating rings, the tube of the Farm was slightly longer than its diameter, having been built that way to facilitate the day-night cycle by using the Farm's walls to block the sun's light at night. Serĉa could see the stars on either end rotating as the Farm made a complete turn around its circular axis every five minutes to provide a sensation of gravity equal to that of the Earth. Although the 'ceiling' was just a few kilometers above the surface (to limit the strength of winds due to Coriolis forces), there was a thin layer of low clouds visible in the sky.</p>
          <p>Ben had remained mostly quiet since leaving the welcome room and allowed Serĉa a few moments of silence to soak in the view before he began talking again.</p>
          <p>"Pretty neat, eh? The pictures don't do it justice, and the TK agreed not to make any VR tours of it so we could keep it just in person."</p>
          <p>They had come out from the subsurface into a garden square in the center of a quaint congregation of wooden hovels. The square was filled with concentric layers of flowerbeds and walkways, with the elevator in the center alongside another of the cylindrical carved maps. It definitely was a map: Ben walked over and began examining it.</p>
          <p>"Yeah, so we're right here; you can see that the map covers the whole Farm -- it's flipped inside out so you don't have to crawl inside to see, you know. I've built myself a little Shangri-La not too far from here, which is good 'cause you pretty much have to walk everywhere you want to go around here." Gesturing around at the buildings bordering the square, he continued, "This here's our effort at a little town to welcome the visitors, a bit of a hobby project, really. Not too many people live here right now; I think it's mostly for show, to be honest. That and to have a place for the tourists that're too lazy to walk anywhere."</p>
          <p>Ben started walking away from the center of the plaza in the direction that Serĉa decided to call "north" -- it was currently the direction from which he could see the sun shining through the opening in the distance.</p>
          <p>"As you get farther from here, you start finding people who're more serious about living simply and all that. On the other side of the Farm there's people that're basically hermits or whatever. Over here, though, we've got a bit more connection with the outside if we want it."</p>
          <p>"Do you work as a guide for visitors often?" Serĉa asked, to try to keep a bit of conversation.</p>
          <p>"Nah," Ben answered, "This is my first time, actually. Was starting to get a bit bored, honestly, and figured this might shake things up."</p>
          <p>"Oh, okay. How long have you been on the Farm?"</p>
          <p>"Me? Just about six years now, I think. I actually came on a visiting trip like you -- was getting tired of thrill-seeking back on Earth and figured I'd give this a try. Got here and kind of liked the slowness of it and figured to hell with it all, you know, why not stay."</p>
          <p>"Oh... okay," Serĉa repeated. He was not planning on making his presence a permanent feature on the Farm.</p>
          <p>"Yeah it's been good for me I think, being here. You probably know this, but there aren't any drugs on the Farm, nothing recreational anyway. The council in charge doesn't want anything interfering with our 'unblemished experience,' or something like that. Well, actually, there's some ways to get some psychedelics but meditation and all that's supposed to be preferable. I was big into the TK's enhancers back on Earth. Like I said, I was all into that-thrill seeking. But not constantly being hopped-up on <em>vite</em> has kind of been a good thing for me out here; you realize there's some things that are best enjoyed slowly, you know."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Ben's bantering continued with few pauses as the two made their way out of the dilapidated village and through the picturesque countryside. The subject of Ben's monologue shifted from drugs, to sex (there wasn't much of it happening on the farm, except for a faddish fascination with something called "neotantra," apparently), to farming (Ben Abn was self-proclaimedly horrible at it), to the pre-transition way of life ("Can you believe it? They would take all these animals and cram them into little cages so they could turn them into food as cheap as they could? Animals! As food!"), before they finally arrived at Ben's "Shangri-La."</p>
          <p>"Not much compared to the lofts you're used to, eh?" Ben remarked as they stood in the entrance to his ovular, thatched-roof hut, "But it's where I call home, so I've developed a liking for it. Got to sleep in a hammock though, or the bugs'll crawl all over you." Serĉa couldn't tell if he was kidding about that last part.</p>
          <p>"Do you have anything I could drink?" Serĉa asked. They'd stopped for a break at a well on the side of the path a few kilometers back, which Ben had explained was connected to a holding tank in the Farm's subsurface, but Serĉa wasn't used to walking so far and was fancying some cold refreshment.</p>
          <p>"Huh? Oh yeah, just water. The stream at the bottom of the hill is clean. You can just scoop it up with that thing over there," Ben said, pointing to a dented metal pot by the hut's entrance.</p>
          <p>Somewhat disappointed that there wasn't even anything fizzy to drink, Serĉa went to retrieve the water while Ben set about preparing a fire to make what he called "vegetable massacre." When Serĉa returned, Ben plopped a couple of large, gnarled root vegetables into the pot and set it on the fire. As the water heated to boiling and the roots slowly cooked, the two men sat watching the curling and leaping fire against the backdrop of the alien evening.</p>
          <p>"I made some code to simulate this once," Serĉa said, somewhat out of the blue.</p>
          <p>"Eh? What?" Ben asked.</p>
          <p>"Fire. I was interested in it because it was such a chaotic system, and it managed to produce such interesting and beautiful behavior. It's hard to simulate because of all the convection and reactions and phase changes, plus fluids are difficult in the first place, but the TK showed me some tricks that made it easier."</p>
          <p>"Oh, oh yeah," Ben said, clearly not fully understanding what Serĉa was talking about, "I never really wanted to look too much into that math-y stuff. I always just kind of appreciated it for being warm, and bright, and, I don't know, artful."</p>
          <p>"Well, yeah, I guess there's that."</p>
          <p>The vegetable massacre was literally nothing more than just the boiled roots, smashed to a mushy consistency. Ben claimed that it was quite nutritious, and seeing Serĉa's face when he tried it, added with a chuckle, "Tastes nearly as good as it looks, eh? You'll get used to it. Amazing what you can enjoy with a bit of mindfulness."</p>
          <p>After stomaching the meal, which was admittedly quite filling, Ben and Serĉa extinguished the fire and sat back against the outside wall of the hut, watching the sun set. It was quite a view to see the sun slinking behind the wall of the Farm, its light forming a burning orange crescent along the edge. When the sun finally disappeared, the only lights left were the sea of stars visible through each opening, with the Earth glowing brightly from the south.</p>
          <p>"Beautiful," Serĉa said.</p>
          <p>"Yeah, that's right," Ben laughed, "Well we better be getting some rest now. I built a hammock for you. I was thinking for tomorrow, I'll just kinda let you do your thing, just let you sit or wander or whatever you're wanting to do. We can just go from there, then. Sound good?"</p>
          <p>"Yeah, sounds fine," Serĉa answered, standing up tiredly, "Let's see how your hammock is."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>The sunrise disturbed Serĉa's sleep as it peeked over the rim of the Farm's southern opening. Serĉa had opted to sleep outside, telling Ben Abn that he wanted to appreciate the view but really just feeling suspicious of the general mustiness of Ben's hut.</p>
          <p>After failing to get back to sleep (he didn't have any <em>tranquille</em> to help him with this), he decided to get up and explore the area around the hut while he waited for Ben to wake up. Ben had built his camp at the top of a rocky hill, shielded on the east by a sizable boulder and looking out over the softly rolling, green landscape on the west. The stream Serĉa had retrieved water from the previous evening trickled along cheerfully at the base of the hill, celebrated by a parade of tall reeds and grasses and a fanfare of winged insects.</p>
          <p>The temperature had been pleasant all night and remained comfortably warm and breezy with the sun out. Evidently the Farm was currently passing through its "autumn" season -- although the Farm could easily regulate its climate to provide comfortable weather all the time, the average temperature was allowed to fluctuate a bit with the changing light intensities on the Farm's elliptical orbit (Ben claimed this was all for the sake of "variety," and that winter on the Farm was really quite nice if you were ready for it). The Farm's wide girth and short period of rotation meant that, in the morning and evening, the sun cast long shadows that stretched and twisted around themselves every few minutes; Serĉa found this to be an interesting, if slightly headache-inducing, effect.</p>
          <p>Serĉa made his way down to the base of the hill and found a seat on one of the rocks at the stream's edge. He sat for a good while, listening to the water burbling by, carrying with it whorls of foam and the occasional bit of plant matter. Winged insects hovered above the surface and periodically touched down to rest on the shore -- they looked like elegant versions of their counterparts on Earth: dragonflies with long, thin bodies and curving wings and mayflies with vibrantly-colored abdomens and shimmering wings. He slipped off his shoes and lowered his feet into the current, inhaling sharply as the cold water covered his skin.</p>
          <p>"Ah, there he is!" Serĉa heard from behind. He twisted around to see Ben making his way down the hill. "It's peaceful, innit?" Ben continued, "It flows down all the way from the mountains, not to far from here."</p>
          <p>"Mountains?" Serĉa asked, his interest piqued. He knew that the Farm boasted some impressive constructed geology but hadn't known there would be mountains so close to where he would be staying. "Can we go see them?"</p>
          <p>"Sure," Ben said, "They're just about maybe twenty kilometers from here, a nice walk. You wanna go?"</p>
          <p>"Why not? Unless you had other plans?</p>
          <p>"Nah, I didn't have much in the way of plans; just figured we could mostly relax -- that's what this place is all about, anyways. So sure, we can go see 'em." Ben stood pensively for a few moments, then mused, "I'll have to go track down another backpack for you, though. I think my neighbor's probably got one I can borrow. We could start tomorrow morning. You okay hanging out here by yourself for a few hours?"</p>
          <p>"Not a problem," Serĉa said, staring back at the river.</p>
          <p>"Alright," Ben went on, "I'll go run some errands then, get you a backpack and some other things. Be back for some lunch. If you're hungry now, there're plenty of fruits around you can eat. There isn't anything that can hurt you if you eat it, anyways."</p>
          <p>Ben turned and made his way back up the hill, leaving Serĉa alone by the stream again. His feet were starting to lose feeling, so he pulled them out of the water, resting them on a stone that protruded from the riverbed, splitting the water on either side. He sat there for a few more minutes before deciding he should address his growing hunger, hopefully with something more appetizing than the vegetable massacre from the night before.</p>
          <p>Along the side of the stream, there was in fact an impressive variety of bushes and brambles, each decorated with its own type of berry. Many of them resembled the traditional fruits grown on the Earth -- blackberries, blueberries, and the like -- but others were more akin to exotic (and wonderfully delicious) berries that Serĉa had tasted from the TK's Agriculture Innovation greenhouses: rainbow pods spiralling around a juicy core, a light-colored covered berry that tasted strongly of vanilla, and another with the consistency and taste of a chocolate candy. Altogether, it wasn't the most balanced meal, but it was an enjoyable tour of flavors that left Serĉa satisfied. He wandered a good way along the stream as he foraged, eventually finding himself at the base of a short cliff where the water spilled over a rocky outcrop into a pristine pool below. Serĉa was tempted to wade in and shower under the waterfall but decided against it given the water's temperature. Instead, he found a smooth spot in the soft grasses on the shore and lied down, simply relaxing. Soon, he could feel the effects of his interrupted sleep from the night before creeping up and settled down for a nap.</p>
          <p>Serĉa woke up several hours later, the waterfall still pounding away beside him. After a few more minutes of relaxation, he stood up and made his way back to Ben Abn's camp. Climbing the hill to the camp, he could see Ben sitting on the ground, reclined against the side of his hut, his eyes closed.</p>
          <p>"Was wondering when you'd wander back," Ben said, opening one eye to look at Serĉa as he approached, "You enjoy yourself?"</p>
          <p>"Ah, sorry to make you wait," Serĉa answered, "You've certainly got a pretty neighborhood here; I'd think I was on a nature preserve if not for the way the sunlight behaves here. I didn't see anyone all morning."</p>
          <p>"Ha, I'm not waiting for anything," Ben chuckled, "You've got to go looking for people around here if you want to see them."</p>
          <p>The two spent the afternoon playing a game Ben had learned from a friend of his on the farm: it involved collecting sets of decorated cards, each worth some amount of points, and trying to outscore the other player. The game was nowhere near as intense or engaging as the video- and sim-games Serĉa was accustomed to playing, but in any case he enjoyed bantering with Ben and figuring out the game's strategies, and the sun was nearing the Farm's edge by the time they finished. They spent the rest of the day lying in their hammocks and having another meal (this time seasoned with a collection of herbs, on Serĉa's insistence).</p>
          <p>As they watched the stars come out, Ben turned and proposed, "So we're off to the mountains tomorrow? What do you say we climb to the very top?"</p>
          <br>

          <h2 id="toward-sinai">Toward Sinai</h2>

          <p>Serĉa woke up early again, and Ben didn't wake up until more than an hour later, by which time Serĉa was beginning to worry he might have to settle with spending the day cataloging the various species of rodents that made their homes in the hilly landscape.</p>
          <p>Ben emerged groggily from his shelter, stretching his arms. "Time to get up and going! We've got a long day of walking," he said, looking then a bit embarrassed as he realized Serĉa was already up, going, and even looking a bit impatient.</p>
          <p>Serĉa watched as Ben retrieved a woven pack from his hut and filled it with the lumpy roots they'd eaten the day before. "We won't be needing any water since there's so many streams around," he explained, "so we'll just need some food for the way. We can pick some fruit along the path if you're hankering for a snack."</p>
          <p>"How long is this going to take again?" Serĉa asked.</p>
          <p>"A day if we're fast. But probably longer; I'm guessing your muscles aren't really trained for mountain-climbing."</p>
          <p>The sun was well into the Farm's southern opening when the two left Ben Abn's camp.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Although the Farm's landscape was mostly quite flat, there were a few mountain spines thrown in among the fields and rolling hills. Because the Farm was not crafted by natural forces, the geography did not need to follow any realistic geological conventions: the mountains that Serĉa and Ben Abn were heading for -- a string of three peaks called <em>les Prêtres du Vent</em> -- rose suddenly from the plains below, decorating the region with their terrifyingly rugged, rocky slopes that reached two kilometers into the air, nearly to the level of the transparent boundary between the Farm's sky and the empty space beyond.</p>
          <p>Serĉa quickly realized that this trip would definitely take more than a day. He and Ben walked for several hours through a landscape much like the area around Ben's camp before the hills and streams gave way to a terrain of marshy brambles and then later to a flat expanse of fields with the <em>Prêtres</em> visible upon the upward-curving land in the distance. By the time they stopped for a midday meal (mainly a bready fruit Ben picked from a field on the side of the path), they must have walked at least ten kilometers, and there was still at least that far to go before reaching the feet of the mountains.</p>
          <p>The path they walked on was lined with fields like the one where they had picked the bread-fruit; a few times they saw people out among the crops, harvesting or simply surveying their bounty.</p>
          <p>As they walked, Ben bombarded Serĉa with thoughts and ideas he had obviously been building up for quite some time and was now happy to have someone with whom to share them: "The TK's ethics aren't universal; they <em>can't</em> be universal!" (He evidently considered himself something of a philosopher.) "Everyone gets taught to seek fulfillment, but the TK was designed for the fulfillment of humanity, not of the folks that make up humanity -- you and me, you know -- maybe what I'm after isn't what the TK has in mind for everyone, right? And then what's gonna happen with me? Maybe I get sent off to live on the Farm," he said with a chuckle, "Or maybe I just get pushed under, lost for the sake of humanity or something like that."</p>
          <p>This was no new ground for Serĉa, who'd encountered arguments like this before in his study at the University. "It's the impossibility theorems," he said.</p>
          <p>"Eh?"</p>
          <p>"Oh, basically just it's very difficult or impossible -- depending on what exactly you're looking for -- to find a way to add up what everyone wants into a sort of coherent way where you can say, 'This is what society wants.' There's a lot of math behind it, but the basic idea is just what you've been saying."</p>
          <p>"Ah now you're making me wish I'd spent more time with the books," Ben said, slightly downcast that he hadn't had an idea that no one else had come up with before.</p>
          <p>"I like the way you've put it, though," Serĉa went on, "It makes me think of it in a different way than what I'd thought before: what happens to the individual person who's fulfillment is out of line with what the TK is after in the big picture?"</p>
          <p>"Yeah, that's the thing!" Ben continued, once again assuming his philosopher role as he had something to contribute, "I mean I don't think I'm personally much of a menace to society -- more of a weirdo, to be honest -- but let's say I was really into, I don't know... let's say I just really wanted to screw everybody else up, like I thought it was fun to make things hard for everybody.</p>
          <p>"What would the TK do with me then? I guess it might have to just separate me from everybody else, but then maybe I wouldn't be happy because there was nobody around for me to screw around with... so maybe the TK would stick me in a VR where I was free to do whatever the hell I wanted, you know. But I guess even then maybe I'd not be happy with that, and I'd want the real thing, 'cause I'd know that the folks I was screwing up weren't conscious and didn't really care..."</p>
          <p>Serĉa interjected: "Well, this is what would happen all the time with criminals and the like back before the TK. They'd end up getting locked up or punished because they wouldn't follow the rules that'd been set up to keep everything running how most people wanted it to be. It's a lot less of an issue now because the TK's more able to manage everyone's preferences to satisfy someone without sacrificing too much on the part of everybody else, but I guess it's a problem that's never going to go away completely."</p>
          <p>"Ah here's an idea, though: what if everybody just wanted the same thing?" Ben asked, "Like everyone just wanted the exact same thing as the TK? The fulfillment of humanity, you know. Wouldn't that just make the problem go away?"</p>
          <p>Serĉa thought about this for a moment before answering, "I suppose so, but I don't think the TK would be willing to change everyone's desires to make that happen. Humanity's diversity is one of the principles that the TK's designers made sure it would respect.... Everyone knows that the TK doesn't lightly manipulate what someone wants."</p>
          <p>"Eh so I guess until we all decide to like the same things, some of us are just gonna have to deal with being dissatisfied," Ben concluded.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Serĉa and Ben arrived at the base of the <em>Prêtres</em> late that evening. Serĉa's muscles were aching awfully -- he had never walked that far in a single day and was not at all looking forward to the mountain climb he still had to look forward to. After a miserable dinner of vegetable massacre, they settled down for sleep (Ben had, luckily, brought the hammocks along).</p>
          <p>Serĉa slept soundly all night and was again woken up by the rising sun, this time emerging from the Farm's north opening. He didn't feel any better than he had the previous evening; if anything, his muscles protested even more as he stood up and began preparing for the day's trek.</p>
          <p>Ben Abn was ready to go much earlier this time, seeming excited for the climb to come. The peaks of the <em>Prêtres</em> could be reached along rocky paths chiseled in spirals up each of the three mountains, and the two men began to climb one of these paths to begin ascending the middle, tallest one.</p>
          <p>"I was thinking about what we were saying yesterday," Ben remarked.</p>
          <p>"What?" Serĉa asked, already out of breath. Ben had rambled about a lot of things the day before.</p>
          <p>"About how not everyone can get fulfillment."</p>
          <p>"Oh, okay, yeah."</p>
          <p>"There's a lot of Buddhists here on the Farm -- well, they call themselves that, anyway, I don't know how authentic you'd think they were compared to a pre-TKer -- but anyway, there's a lot of them here, and I've spent some time talking to them and learned a thing or two about what they think.</p>
          <p>"They're always going on about how we've got to get rid of our desires, how that's what brings us suffering -- it's our wanting things that makes us unhappy -- and if we bring all that under control, that's how we get their <em>nirvana</em>. It's pretty different from what they teach at the University -- I guess that's why they're here instead of Earth, you know -- but I was thinking maybe it isn't really all that different.</p>
          <p>"Maybe they've just found another answer to the problem we were talking about -- that if we just get rid of all of our desires, there's no push-and-pull between us anymore, no, you know, conflict. I guess it's really not too different from the TK just stepping in and saying, 'This is what you're going to want now, because what you were wanting before just wasn't working out,' you know, but maybe it's not quite the same because now we're saying, if you're dissatisfied, if your fulfillment is going against humanity's, then there's this path you can take -- you can just get rid of your desires...."</p>
          <p>Ben Abn trailed off at this point, clearly entrenched in thought. Serĉa, sweating furiously and breathing heavily, was having trouble mustering up the brainpower to respond.</p>
          <p>After a few minutes, Ben resumed his monologue: "You know, I guess that's kind of what happened to me -- a sort of Buddhist conversion, course I wouldn't call myself one; they've just kind of rubbed off on me. I used to be so tied up in looking for satisfaction, spending all my time on the Vite, and the wild sex, and the <em>constant</em> action, and I mean the TK's was pretty good at making sure I got all that... of course, it would put me through the rigmarole on the way there -- 'enjoy the struggle' and all that... but then I came here, and there wasn't any of that anymore: just me, and my thoughts, and all this!" (He gestured around him at the landscape.) "And I had to slow down and just take it in and realize, you know what, this is really kind of neat, too. And I guess I realized that this was enough to satisfy me. You know what, I honestly think I'm happier now than I was back on Earth -- I mean, must have stayed here for a reason, right?</p>
          <p>"And I don't think everyone's gonna be the same way -- like me, you know -- and find that they really just want to take it slow, and spend their time making things with their hands, and walking, and watching the sun set, just soaking it in, you know. Maybe some people want it fast. They want to lose themselves in those pleasures... and the TK lets them have it. And of course there's people that are not wanting any of that at all around here, and the TK lets them have it too, I suppose.</p>
          <p>"But I just can't help thinking, maybe we've got it all wrong; maybe the folks that made the TK really screwed things up, and it's not about this perpetual growth, this looking for fulfillment; maybe we already had everything we needed."</p>
          <p>Serĉa's strength was flagging. "Can we take a break here?" he asked.</p>
          <p>Ben nodded in assent and Serĉa sat down on a rock on the side of the trail, placing his elbows on his knees and looking out over the plain below. They had made it a couple hundred meters up the mountain, having made nearly a full circle around the spiraling path.</p>
          <p>When he had caught his breath, Serĉa shifted to look at Ben and said, "What you were saying just now? Getting rid of our desires? I don't think that's right. If we all did that, what would make us different from rocks? Wanting things is part of what makes us human."</p>
          <p>"Maybe the rocks have got the right idea, then," Ben laughed, "But I'm not saying we should all go all the way and drop everything we care about... just that, maybe we should just be more content with what we've got."</p>
          <p>"Ah, well, I don't think that's an unusual thought," Serĉa responded, "That's a big part of fulfillment after all. But if we were all <em>perfectly</em> content, if we didn't want anything, where would the progress come from? How would we achieve greater and greater things? We'd be stuck."</p>
          <p>"That's what I'm saying, that who says there needs to be progress? Who decided we had to keep getting better and better? Whatever 'better' is supposed to mean in the first place... why don't we just stop where we're at and realize how neat it is?"</p>
          <p>Serĉa chewed on his lower lip as he thought for a moment. "Just think about the pre-transition, though. Do you really think it would be better to live back then? Don't you think that the progress we've made since then is worthwhile, or that we <em>have</em> made progress at all?"</p>
          <p>"I don't know," Ben mused, "Just maybe those people back then were capable of fulfillment even with what they had, and we're just making things more complicated than they need to be now."</p>
          <p>"Maybe... but I just... I just have a hard time seeing it."</p>
          <p>The two sat in silence for a few minutes, before Ben asked, "You ready to start walking again?"</p>
          <p>Serĉa was still wanting to rest, but he was afraid he would seize up if he didn't keep moving. "Yeah, let's get on it."</p>
          <p>There was still a very long way to go.</p>
          <br>

          <h2 id="la-vie-la-mort-et-le-prêtre"><em>La vie, la mort, et le prêtre</em></h2>
          <p>The winding path up the mountain was grueling, and Serĉa's diminishing strength meant that his and Ben's progress was increasingly slow as they continued ascending. Serĉa thought it was ridiculous that Ben had suggested that the entire trip was doable in a single day; at the rate they were moving it looked like they wouldn't even reach the summit before the end of this, their second, day. The climb was made no easier by the winds that buffeted them from every direction as they walked. The Farm's spin to maintain an Earth-like "gravity" meant that any air rising from the lower layers of the atmosphere would have the momentum of its rotation converted into a ferocious wind in the direction the Farm was spinning (and any air falling from above would be blown in the opposite direction); the difference in temperature between the lower and upper layers of sky was kept as small as possible to mitigate this effect, but the steep slopes of the <em>Prêtres</em> acted as rudders that guided the prevailing air currents up and down, hence the name of the mountains: <em>les Prêtres du Vent</em>,  the priests of the wind.</p>
          <p>There was a waterfall that tumbled down one side of the mountain. The water provided a refreshing spot to rehydrate and take a short break every time they came around to it, but it also provided a challenging obstacle since they had to wade through the water as it flowed over the path, and the wind dispersed some of the water as a mist that drenched their skin and made the rocks slippery and the dirt muddy.</p>
          <p>Serĉa began to wonder why had signed up for this ridiculous adventure. His goal had been to observe the ways of life on the Free Spaces, not to participate in the silly asceticism of the people who lived there. Although he'd judged Ben Abn as peculiar and entertaining at first, the pain that was constantly arriving from his feet and legs was starting to convince him that Ben was at his core a sadistic rot who ought to have been locked away like in the scenario they had discussed the evening before.</p>
          <p>The only thing keeping him sane was this excerpt from a book he had read at the University, which he repeated over and over in his head:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>You look aloft when you long for exaltation, and I look downward because I am exalted. Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted? He who climbs on the highest mountains laughs at all tragic plays and tragic realities....</p>
          <p>And whatever may still overtake me as fate and experience -- a wandering will be therein, and a mountain-climbing: in the end, one experiences only oneself.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Of course, that really wasn't too much solace, seeing as the author -- an eccentric, pre-TK philosopher called Nietzsche -- had eventually gone insane himself. Apparently the act of experiencing "only oneself" was something of a risky endeavor.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Serĉa and Ben made it nearly to the summit by the time the light began fading that evening. Ben stated that they could have made it all the way up, but he wanted to be able to see the sunrise from the peak, and it was too windy to camp on top. Instead, they set up a makeshift campsite by the source of the waterfall (it looked like the water was pumped up and emerged from a fissure near the peak) and bedded down until morning.</p>
          <p>The wind rushed incessantly over Serĉa's hammock all night, and he slept dismally. Finally, while the mountainside was still shrouded in shadows, Ben rolled out of his bed and grunted to Serĉa that it was time to go.</p>
          <p>They packed up their camp quickly and resumed trudging up the trail, leaving the water's roaring and burbling behind. The last section of the climb was a steep scramble that ran through a ravine at the waterfall's head and then turned and extended up along a rocky ridge to the summit. The final hundred meters or so were covered with loose rocks that slid out from under their feet as they climbed and made jarring, clattering noises while tumbling toward the precipice below. The sun was only just starting to show itself in the south, so it was difficult to see their footing, and they had to test each step carefully.</p>
          <p>Finally, Ben clambered over a jumble of rocks ahead of Serĉa and exclaimed, "Hey! We've made it! You've got it! And in time for the sunrise, too."</p>
          <p>Serĉa put the last of his energy into the remaining stretch and took it at double-speed. At the top, he found Ben Abn standing, looking toward the south where the sliver of sun was progressively illuminating the land.</p>
          <p>Nearly every part of the Farm's varied quilt of hills, streams, fields, and mountains was visible from this vantage point, all veiled in a swirling cloak of morning mists. The two other <em>Prêtres</em> stood in companionship on the east and on the west, each half-illuminated by the growing crescent of sun as it touched on them with glowing, milky spears through the mist. The shadows danced in slow circles as the Farm turned, each turn bringing the sun farther into view. Within a few turns, it had fully emerged, announcing the arrival of day on the alien landscape.</p>
          <p>Serĉa and Ben stood for quite some time, absorbing the view, before Ben spoke.</p>
          <p>"Amazing, huh? You feel alive here, you know. The wind and the view and the... I don't know, you just feel alive." The wind picked up in that moment, rushing up and over the peak as if to add an amen to Ben's statement.</p>
          <p>Serĉa nodded slowly and sat down, wanting to give his legs a rest before heading back down. "How many times have you been up here before?" he asked.</p>
          <p>"Oh, this'll be my third," Ben answered, "After I got to the Farm, I spent some time touring around the place for a few months, climbed some mountains along the way -- seemed like a familiar thing 'cause I was real into that sort of thing back on Earth, except there I'd usually jump off or something afterward; can't do that here -- anyway, I thought this was one of the better ones, climbed it right after I got here and then again after I'd set up my house. It's real dramatic how it rises out of the fields, you know. The <em>Anaranjados</em> are pretty good, too though," he pointed up toward somewhere on the opposite side of the Farm, "but these three guys are my favorite."</p>
          <p>"I suppose you'll be wanting to head down soon?" Serĉa asked.</p>
          <p>Ben laughed, "Oh, take your time. Enjoy the view. Get some meditating in or whatever it was you wanted to do on the Farm. Just don't get blown off the edge," he added with a grin, "It'd be quite the tumble to the bottom."</p>
          <p>They both sat in silence for some time before Serĉa spoke again, "Are you planning on ever leaving the Farm?"</p>
          <p>"Oh I don't know," Ben said, "Probably, eventually. There's still a lot I'd like to do here. I've found I like working with my hands, doing things from the ground up, so I'd kind of like to at least get decent at doing it before giving up on this place. You know, I'd like to figure out how to grow things, and build myself a house better than that shack I've got right now. Maybe learn to draw or something. I guess I could do all that back on Earth, but it all seems a bit more meaningful here, maybe 'cause there's not much to distract me. It's like a studio for me I guess.</p>
          <p>"But yeah, I guess I'll eventually get bored and want to go and find fulfillment someplace else. There's people here that want to just die here, but I don't think I'm one of them. Maybe I'll raise a kid or two -- it's a bit hard to do that on the Farm; the TK's strict about making sure they're brought up good, which is hard work for the parents here -- I never had any kids on Earth, seemed like too much of an ordeal, too much attachment involved... but not so much anymore, after I've been here for a while..."</p>
          <p>After a brief pause, he turned toward Serĉa and asked with a quizzical smile, "What? You planning on staying here like I did?"</p>
          <p>"Not if my legs have anything to say about it," Serĉa replied with a chuckle, "I was just curious.</p>
          <p>"Speaking of my legs," Serĉa added, "We better start down now, or I'm afraid I'll shortly be turning completely stiff."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Serĉa and Ben began descending the side of the mountain, carefully choosing their footing on the treacherous slope. Serĉa had hoped it would be easier going down since the sun was fully out to light the way, but he hadn't counted on the difficulty of making sure his momentum didn't get out of control. Every step down would dislodge a rock or two, occasionally sending one tumbling chaotically downward and sparking a miniature avalanche of pebbles and stones. Ben had made Serĉa go down first so that debris wouldn't fall on him, but Ben's footing wasn't excellent either, and Serĉa would periodically be nailed in the ankle by a stray rock ejected by Ben's shoes.</p>
          <p>"It's trickier going down than up," Serĉa commented.</p>
          <p>"Just be glad we're not doing it in the winter when there's snow and ice everywhere," Ben answered, "I tried to climb one of the other peaks too late in the season and had to turn back when I was nearly at the top 'cause it was too slippery."</p>
          <p>Just a few seconds later, Serĉa heard Ben swear along with a loud clattering of rocks. He looked up to see Ben falling on his back on the uneven ground, a wave of rubble bouncing down the slope toward Serĉa. Serĉa tried to move out of the way, but this only made things worse as he was then off-balance as the barrage of earth swept his feet out from under him.</p>
          <p>The landslide picked Serĉa up with it, cutting into his skin as it did so. He tried to slow himself, but it seemed as if the entire mountainside was collapsing under him. He stretched his arms out to find something to hold onto but only succeeding in scratching and battering his hands and wrists. Frantically, he looked down at the cliff below. If he couldn't find a way to slow himself or redirect his movement toward the ravine they had come up, he would slide right off the edge.</p>
          <p>Something hit the top of his head. His vision went spotty as he continued trying to slow himself. The rocks underneath were tearing up his back and legs. Suddenly, he stopped, the sudden deceleration violently jarring his legs -- he'd hit some sort of invisible barrier. The stones tumbling along with him continued attacking his skin and pinned him against the barrier. He struggled to free himself but quickly stopped since it just made it worse. It had happened so quickly, and now the pain was starting to catch up.</p>
          <p>"Oh, I'm never gonna hear the last of this." Ben Abn must have reached him. "Boy, you're damn lucky they put up a bumper for you."</p>
          <p>There was a whirring and rushing of air as a shadow passed over him. Through his mottled vision, he could see something descending toward him. Some sort of airship? The rocks that had been pressing into him were removed. He could see Ben standing over him along with... it must be some kind of drone...</p>
          <p>"God, he's bleeding a lot -- that's worse than my skiing accident."</p>
          <p>The drone lifted him off the uneven ground. "You'll be alright, Serĉa," it said, "I'm giving you some painkiller now. You might lose consciousness briefly. We may have to take you back to Earth."</p>
          <p>The best he could do was groan as he felt something prick his arm. Soon, the pain began to fade. He suddenly felt groggy; his vision cleared but then faded.</p>
          <p>"Oh god, I'm sorry; I'm sorry. God, they won't be letting me host anyone again after this."</p>
          <p>"He'll be fine. The TK was watching out for him. He'll be fine."</p>
          <p>"God, I hope so."</p>
          <p>Serĉa lost consciousness.</p>
