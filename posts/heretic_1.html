          <h2 id="among-the-unfaithful">Among the unfaithful</h2>
          <p>Kamarado Pablo de Francisco walked among the winding, canyon-like streets of Guatemala City. The buildings on either side rose wildly,  their intricately decorated, vine-covered faces obscuring the ground in shadow.</p>
          <p>The kamarado was freshly arrived from the Central California Metropolitan Division and was still adjusting to the qualities of the new city. Without his Assistant, he would have been lost right away.</p>
          <p>"You'll want to take a right here," his Assistant said.</p>
          <p>"Thanks," he responded, taking the turn with his neck still craned upward, admiring the architecture.</p>
          <p>Ka. Pablo was a member of the Order of True Knowledge, a ministry that had emerged in the wake of the TK's ascendance, composed of devotees of the TK's Ethics who made it their duty to disseminate those Ethics to the world. The TK, of course, needed no assistance in spreading its ideas but still actively fostered the Order as a means of fulfillment for its adherents and for the social and cultural benefits it generated. Ka. Pablo had begun studying the teachings of the Order during his time in the University and had taken his vow of service with the Mission of San Francisco shortly after completing his studies, thereby becoming a kamarado -- a "priest" of the True Knowledge. He had assisted another kamarado in leading a congregation for several years, but, wanting to seek his fulfillment in other ways, the TK had suggested he engage in some true missionary work among the unfaithful -- those who persisted in rejecting the Ethics of the True Knowledge. There was, apparently, a sizable group of these heretics gaining some traction in the Guatemala Metropolitan Division, so Ka. Pablo made his mind up to leave for Guatemala City and spread the word of True Knowledge there.</p>
          <p>The TK had secured Ka. Pablo an apartment near the city's Historic Center, and so the kamarado was heading there now. Guatemala was quite unlike the places he was accustomed to: the buildings -- at least in the district he was in -- were much more closely packed than in California, and the vegetation that covered the buildings and lined the streets seemed more gangly and exotic than back home. At 1.5 kilometers of altitude, the air was rather thin, and he felt this as he shouldered his heavy pack of possessions.</p>
          <p>"Would you like me to get a drone to carry that for you?" his Assistant asked, referring to his backpack.</p>
          <p>"No it's quite fine," the kamarado answered, "I could use the exercise anyway."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>The apartment was on the 83rd floor, about halfway up a tower about a kilometer from where Ka. Pablo had arrived in the city. The apartment itself was a single, moderately sized room -- it didn't need to be anything fancy, since he wouldn't be spending much time in it anyway -- that opened on one side to the street and on the other to the hallways and elevated parks on the interior of the building. Most of the city was laid out in this fashion, with skyscrapers containing residences, businesses, and public areas. The high rises were connected with bridges every few floors to make it easy to get around on the upper levels. It would be entirely possible for a person here to live an exciting, social, and fulfilled life without ever touching the ground.</p>
          <p>After picking up dinner from a nearby café, Ka. Pablo returned to his room where he began arranging things to his liking while he waited for a visitor to arrive -- he'd been told that a member of the local Order was coming to meet him and introduce him to the city. He picked his pack up from where he'd left it on the floor by the apartment's entrance and began unloading the bundles of clothing and personal items he'd brought with him. At the bottom of the pack he found his most prized possession: a hand-written and illuminated copy of <em>Herein is Flourishing</em>, one of the principle scriptures of the Order. He'd received it from a kamarado he'd befriended at the Mission of San Francisco who had spent a great deal of the last decade creating such books as a sort of meditative practice. It was of course unnecessary to have such an extravagance, given that any book imaginable was easily accessible through an Assistant, but Ka. Pablo appreciated it for its sentimental and artistic qualities. He placed the volume in a prominent position on a shelf next to the bed.</p>
          <p>"Your guest is here," Ka. Pablo's Assistant apprised.</p>
          <p>"Oh, let him in!"</p>
          <p>The door slid open, revealing the woman on the other side.</p>
          <p>"True Knowledge, friend," she said, bowing in greeting.</p>
          <p>"True Knowledge, friend," Ka. Pablo bowed back.</p>
          <p>"I hope I haven't gotten here before you've had time to settle in," she said, "I know you've only just arrived."</p>
          <p>"No, no," he responded, "Your timing is great. I've already eaten, even."</p>
          <p>"Oh, wonderful," she said, then stopped, remembering, "I'm Kamarado Marta, by the way, in case your Assistant hasn't already told you."</p>
          <p>"A pleasure to meet, you Kamarado Marta," he replied, bowing again, "We can take a seat, if you like."</p>
          <p>A pair of sofas unfolded from the walls in the corner opposite the window, and the two sat down, facing each other.</p>
          <p>"How are you enjoying the city so far?" Ka. Marta asked.</p>
          <p>"It's quite exciting, I have to say. Very different from what I'm used to. I quite like the architecture, and the height of all the buildings is quite dizzying. I think I bent my neck out of shape trying to see the top on my way from the station. Would you like something to drink?"</p>
          <p>"Oh just something with a bit of <em>Heureux</em>, if you please."</p>
          <p>"Sounds fantastic," Ka. Pablo said, noting that his Assistant had recorded the request, "Yes, I've quite enjoyed the evening I've spent here so far -- goodness, I was in San José just a few hours ago -- I haven't done much travel, you see, a bit during University of course, but not much since I finished; I've mostly stuck to the mission and the congregation I was with."</p>
          <p>"Are you from Central California originally then?"</p>
          <p>"Yes, yes, that's where I was raised. Not my parents, though: my dad is from Mexico City (he was actually born right before the transition, interestingly enough) and my mom is from Tegucigalpa -- not to far from here -- that's part of why I've ended up down here; the TK thought I might fit in, though to be honest I don't even know any of the local languages, and I'm sure my accent is plain obvious."</p>
          <p>"Oh you shouldn't worry about that. Most everyone speaks Standard nowadays, anyway. They still teach Spanish and a few of the more obscure ones to those interested, but to be honest, I could hardly claim to be fluent in anything beside Standard, myself. Even the unfaithful have mostly taken to it, for convenience sake. And of course you can always use your Assistant to translate if you need to; hardly anyone will mind that."</p>
          <p>"Well that's a relief to know. To be honest, I didn't know much about Guatemala before coming here -- this whole trip is a bit of a new experience for me; I think that's what the TK had in mind in suggesting I come here, but I do feel a bit out of my comfort zone."</p>
          <p>"If I may interrupt," Ka. Pablo's assistant spoke up, politely, "There is a courier at the door with the heureuxwine you requested."</p>
          <p>"Ah fantastic!" Ka. Pablo said, "Let him in, of course."</p>
          <p>As he stood up to walk to the door, he commented, "I was wondering if they would send a courier or just a drone. Seems they wanted to bless us with a bit of human company."</p>
          <p>The door slid open as he approached it; a young man -- probably in his late teens -- stood in the hallway with a fancy crystalline bottle in hand. "Your heureuxwine, kamarado," he said, holding the bottle out to Ka. Pablo.</p>
          <p>"Thank you very much, friend," Ka. Pablo answered, taking the bottle from him, "Would you like to join us for a moment to have some yourself?"</p>
          <p>"No, thank you," the courier responded, "I'm plenty happy already to be able to serve you."</p>
          <p>"Oh, it's my pleasure to be served. To your fulfillment, then," Ka. Pablo said, as he waved the young man off. Walking back to his couch, he said to Ka. Marta, "Should we have a reading before we drink?"</p>
          <p>"A wonderful idea," she replied.</p>
          <p>He set the heureuxwine on a small table between the sofas and then walked over to the bookshelf where he had stashed his copy of <em>Herein is Flourishing</em>. Bringing it back to the couches (Ka. Marta commented enthusiastically on the book's artistry), he flipped it open, and read:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>Motes of snow slowly drift down,</p>
          <p>gracing the ground with their frozen tranquility;</p>
          <p>yet the soft wind that pulled them from the pines</p>
          <p>carries also murmurs of hostility,</p>
          <p>since mixed with the benignness in this place,</p>
          <p>I find the frightening echo of nothing:</p>
          <p>filled with too much wanting,</p>
          <p>my creature fears annihilation</p>
          <p>from surrendering its desperate passions</p>
          <p>to the perfection that was always present here --</p>
          <p>the perfection of this moment.</p>
          <p>The specter of Truth's unity unnerves me</p>
          <p>as it empties me and lets my insides mix with heaven's mess.</p>
          <p>Still, this is Flourishing:</p>
          <p>flooded with emotion,</p>
          <p>all I can think is, "Thank you."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>"Ah!" Ka. Marta clasped her hands together. "That's from the Alpine Verse, no? One of my favorite parts."</p>
          <p>"Yes, one of my favorites as well." Ka. Pablo set the book down on the table and walked to the kitchenware dispenser, where he retrieved two glasses for the heureuxwine. Handing one to his guest, he asked, "What advice do you have for me before I start engaging with the unfaithful? I'm thinking to start tomorrow, but I don't want to try anything you all have already tried."</p>
          <p>"Oh," she sighed, as she filled her glass, "Unfortunately we're a bit understaffed around here. The Order is still quite new, at least compared to what you're probably used to, and most of our effort has gone to setting up congregations and training new kamarados. I've been one of the only ones to start engaging with the unfaithful, and it really hasn't gone so well so far.</p>
          <p>"They're awfully stubborn. You'd think that after so long with the TK they'd realize the goodness of its Ethics, but I suppose people will persist in their ways; they're awfully unwilling to consider they might be wrong. I think a big part of it is that some of them were around before the TK, and they were some of the ones that didn't just agree to go to a Free Space when things started changing. A bit hypocritical, if you ask me, seeing as there's no way they'd still be around if not for the TK's medical knowledge -- but anyhow, they've riled up the younger ones, and now there's a proper movement of unfaithful stomping around and causing trouble, taking away from the fulfillment of everyone else. The thing is, the TK can't do much about it directly, because that might hurt the fulfillment of the unfaithful (a strange concept that is: the fulfillment of the <em>unfaithful</em>), and most of them have completely sworn off the standard media because they don't want to be 'corrupted' -- I think that's the wording they use. So they just live in this bubble of their backward beliefs, being a nuisance." She paused to take a sip. "And like I said, it's been a bit rough so far, certainly a struggle, but I suppose it's often through struggle we find fulfillment, no?"</p>
          <p>The two kamarados sat facing each other, glasses in hand, for a few moments, before Ka. Pablo picked up the conversation. "Well I suppose I'm in for a struggle, too, then. Where would you recommend I start?"</p>
          <p>"Most of them are in the old Historic Center. They've set up something of an encampment around the old <em>Cerrito del Carmen</em>. If you go over that way, you'll run into them. Hardly any need to look, even: they'll find you."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>It was already late in the morning when Ka. Pablo left his apartment to make his way to the Historic Center. He and Ka. Marta had stayed up quite late the night before enjoying each other's company, so his start had been later than he'd have preferred. Even still, he felt refreshed and ready to take on the task of sharing the True Knowledge.</p>
          <p>He began walking along the elevated bridges and platforms toward the city's Historic Center. As he walked, the average building height slowly decreased, and he had to descend back to ground level.</p>
          <p>The Historic Center was a section of the city -- about four square kilometers -- that had been preserved during the city's development to keep some of the city's historical origins. Some buildings had fallen into disrepair and been replaced with period-appropriate replicas, but many others had been maintained as the originals, dating from the transition period and even hundreds of years before. Ka. Pablo had seen similar historic zones before -- most of the major cities from the pre-transition had retained some older buildings -- but this one was larger than most of the others, and the outskirts had an altogether run-down feeling that contrasted sharply with the towering, vine-covered metropolis he had just left. He noticed that some of the buildings had walls topped with razor wire, and most of the windows were covered in bars. Apparently this area was not the safest place to be before the transition. As he continued walking, the short, gated houses and shops gave way to more intricately decorated two and three-story buildings, and the streets filled with activity. Most of the businesses here were still active (although they typically offered their services for free, of course), and the area seemed to be a favorite destination for the city's people to come for an afternoon of diversion. This was more typical of the historic zones that the kamarado had seen elsewhere.</p>
          <p>The streets suddenly opened into a large square full of chatting people, entertainers, and what looked like a few artistic exhibitions. This looked like as good a place as any for Ka. Pablo to begin his work. He made his way through the crowd to a fountain, where he began to speak:</p>
          <p>"Friends!" he gestured to those around him, some of whom turned toward him -- they recognized him as a kamarado by the characteristic shimmering robe he wore and weren't unaccustomed to kamarados speaking in public like this -- "I've traveled from far away on a mission from the True Knowledge to help right wrongs that have been going on among you. I'm sure that most of you are believers in the beautiful Ethics of the True Knowledge; I'm sure that most of you diligently seek fulfillment and flourishing, but there are many in this city who have rejected the blessings of the True Knowledge and persist in following the inadequate ways of past times. They have not learned the words of scripture -- let me read for you from <em>The Truer Ethic</em>." He began reading from the interface of his Assistant:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The human creature comes pre-packaged with a conscience,
          but it doesn't take a skillful science to see the ancient setup is outdated.
          The capabilities of the simple social compass that functioned for our prehistoric parents
          are easily surpassed by the moral mazes that the modern world presents.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
          <p>How can an instinct developed to resolve disputes between the likes of Cain and Abel make <em>us</em> able to restrain the tide of ethical conundrums that came when this world ceased to be an agar dish for isolated tribes?
          Their time and culture were consumed, and now this earth's a cultural Pangaea.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
          <p>Take care! To treat the troubles of this globalized machine, the past genetic quasi-sociability simply won't suffice.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>"'The ancient setup is outdated,' it says. Of course! Who could argue with this? There may be some of you who remember the times before we were blessed with the True Knowledge. Wouldn't you say that the world has changed? Hasn't it changed for the better? Wouldn't a better world necessitate a better guide to direct our Ethics? Of course! We're standing here, right now, in the heart of a city from a different age. We can see its marks, handed down through time to us. Imagine for a moment, each of you, the people who walked these streets, who wandered through this plaza in the time before the True Knowledge. These were people just like you and I -- they each had their own desperate struggle for fulfillment, but without the elevated knowledge we have, they struggled against the often insurmountable obstacles around them to achieve that fulfillment. In this past world, there was sickness, there were tragedies of premature death, there was suffering that you and I could hardly fathom let alone experience, and everywhere, everyone went looking for the things they thought they wanted, but without the wisdom of the True Knowledge to guide them on the way. Think for a moment: where would you be without the direction of the True Knowledge in your life? Would you have the fulfillment you have now? Would you experience the pleasures you do now? Would you have the fantastic, intimate connections you have with your friends, family, and mates without the faultless guide of the True Knowledge? No -- without the True Knowledge, all these things could only appear as shadows of what we have today."</p>
          <p>At this point, the kamarado had collected a sizable audience, fanned out around him as he spoke. All of a sudden, at a lull in his speech, someone in the back of the crowd began shouting.</p>
          <p>"<em>Herético</em>! You that come here and sell the lies of that machine to us -- that's what you are: <em>herético</em>! Me and my brothers -- are we the only ones who still have faith? And you call <em>us</em> faithless. <em>Heréticos</em>! You and your damned <em>pendejos</em> of followers will burn in hell."</p>
          <p>This was it. This man was clearly one of the unfaithful. These were the people that Ka. Pablo had come to confront. Surprised by the man's audaciousness but resolute in his goal, the kamarado turned his attention to the man and spoke to him: "You, my friend and brother, must be one of those who clings to the ways of times past. It's for your fulfillment that my comrades and I worry day and night. Why do you reject the True Knowledge?"</p>
          <p>The man was plainly boiling over with anger. "You worry about me?" he spat, "No, you're too caught up in your sensuality -- your selfish pleasure-seeking -- you don't worry about anything except the lies the machine has fed you. You're brainwashed; you're a child of the devil, and you think to say that you care about my 'fulfillment?' You call me a friend? You're only trying to drag me down with you."</p>
          <p>The confrontation was causing a sizable commotion in the crowd. Most of the audience seemed to side with Ka. Pablo, but there were also a few who began shouting in support of the other man. The scene was devolving into a cacophony of mingled shouting matches; the kamarado had evidently lost control of the situation. Realizing that this was not the right way to engage with the unfaithful, he approached the other man and spoke through the ambient yells.</p>
          <p>"Friend, I can see that this is not the place to resolve our differences. Would it be possible for us to meet without the crowd, to talk in a more civilized fashion?"</p>
          <p>The man glared at Ka. Pablo for a few seconds before responding, "Tomorrow. At the <em>Cerrito del Carmen</em>. Me and my brothers will be ready to show you your error. Come before noon." The man turned and walked away.</p>
          <p>After the man left, Ka. Pablo was able to calm down the crowd and share a more conventional sermon. In the back of his mind, though, he was profoundly jarred by the experience. Never before had he been yelled at in that way, or seen that kind of anger, or been so vociferously ridiculed for the beliefs he found to be so good and obviously true. He wondered how the unfaithful had convinced themselves so thoroughly to the degree that they were willing to show such resentment and cause such a scene.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>That evening, after returning to his apartment, Ka. Pablo recorded some of his thoughts.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The unfaithful who confronted me today showed a brashness I'm not used to. I'm realizing how much the teaching of the TK has permeated my life. I suppose I hadn't thought that someone could have different ideas so strongly that they would argue in that way against the TK... Ka. Marta was right that this is going to be difficult. A part of me wonders if someone like me is going to be able to make an appreciable difference. I feel like what happened in the plaza might have made things worse, not better.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
          <p>My Assistant has warned me that the unfaithful may mean me harm if I meet with them tomorrow. They can't hurt me too badly -- the TK wouldn't allow that -- but even the TK can't guarantee that my experience with them won't be unpleasant for me. Making them feel powerless would interrupt their fulfillment. This might be the type of trial of the faithful I've read about in so many stories. I thought it would be a great fulfillment to show my devotion in this kind of way, but at the opportunity to do it I'm finding myself... scared.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <hr>
          <p>The <em>Cerrito del Carmen</em> was a small hill on the edge of the Historic Center where the first building in the city -- a church -- had been built over half a millennium before. The church itself had been rebuilt several times over the years, but the site had apparently become a focal point for the unfaithful to organize around. The Cerrito was covered in lush gardens of philodendron plants and bright orange flowers and had several stone paths leading up to the edifice at the top.</p>
          <p>As Ka. Pablo made his way through the gardens, he saw a group of men standing in front of the church who looked like they were waiting for him. Indeed, as he got closer, they spotted him and started walking toward him, meeting him on a wide staircase near the top of the hill.</p>
          <p>The group was made up of about a dozen, plainly-dressed men. The man from the day before was at the center of the pack and appeared to be their leader. Ka. Pablo bowed, as the customary greeting, and the man returned the gesture with a terse nod.</p>
          <p>"You came, <em>herético</em>. Maybe you are not so <em>cobarde</em> as I thought."</p>
          <p>"Of course, my friend. These are the brothers you mentioned?"</p>
          <p>"Yes, these are my brothers in faith." He gave an odd sort of smile as he said this. "I did not introduce myself properly yesterday. My name is Mateo Hernández-Lopez."</p>
          <p>"It's my pleasure to meet you and your brothers in a more favorable light. You can call me Karamado Pablo."</p>
          <p>"Well, <em>Pablo</em>," Mateo responded, "We've set aside a space for our study near here. You can go with us there."</p>
          <p>The group turned to take a path down the hill, exiting the gardens on the opposite side from where Ka. Pablo had entered. They walked for a few minutes in a loose pack around the karamado.</p>
          <p>"Where exactly are we heading?" Ka. Pablo asked, starting to feel nervous again.</p>
          <p>"Martín lives very near here. We're going to his house for our discussion," Mateo said, pointing to another man at the head of the group. Then, as they turned a corner, he continued, "It's on this street."</p>
          <p>They walked up to a two-story, yellow house in the center of the block, and Martín opened the front door.</p>
          <p>"One moment," Mateo interrupted, turning back to Ka. Pablo, "I hope you have not brought any weapons. We would not appreciate that disrespect to one of our homes."</p>
          <p>"Of course not," the karamado replied, somewhat indignantly (but concealing his rising anxiety), "I'm a teacher and guide for the people -- why would I need a weapon?"</p>
          <p>"We are always cautious of treachery from the servants of the machine." Apparently they were still far from warm toward the karamado.</p>
          <p>They entered the house. The interior was designed in an antique fashion. Although Ka. Pablo spotted some modern conveniences like a recycling chute and some modular furniture, it looked like some others had been stripped out. This did nothing to calm his nerves.</p>
          <p>"We'll be in the next room," Mateo said.</p>
          <p>As they shuffled into the next room, Ka. Pablo noticed it wasn't much of a room, and certainly wasn't a good venue for a group discussion. He faltered in the doorway but was pushed forward by the men behind him.</p>
          <p>Mateo turned around and, with a stern face, demanded, "Take off your Assistant."</p>
          <p>This was exactly the sort of situation that Ka. Pablo had been worried about. He looked around at the now obviously hostile faces surrounding him and knew it would be best to comply. As he began disconnecting his Assistant from his arm, it spoke softly in his ear, "The True Knowledge won't abandon you here. You will be alright. You are capable." He dropped the armpiece to the floor.</p>
          <p>"The headpiece, too," Mateo directed.</p>
          <p>The karamado removed his headpiece. The group bustled around him, and Mateo looked him in the eyes with open disdain.</p>
          <p>"You'll be our visitor here for a while," Mateo said, "This will be a good lesson for you and your <em>maldito</em> group of 'friends,' I think." He motioned to his companions, "Get on out, boys. Let's give our guest some time alone before our <em>study session.</em>" He and the others filed out of the room; as he was exiting through the door, he turned back and said to the kamarado, "Maybe we'll make you see some sense, too, eh, <em>herético</em>?"</p>
          <p>The door closed with a click, and Ka. Pablo was left with the words of his Assistant in his head: "The True Knowledge won't abandon you here." This would be a true test of his faith.</p>
