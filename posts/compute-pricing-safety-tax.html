	<h1 id="post-title">Compute pricing and the AI safety tax</h1>
	<div id="post-content" class="in-content">
		<p><em>This is a summary of a paper I created with Robert Trager and Nicholas Emery-Xu. The full version is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11436">available on arXiv</a>.</em></p>

		<p>Using a model in which actors compete to develop a potentially
			dangerous new technology (advanced AI), we study how changes in the
			price of compute affect actors’ spending on safety. In the model, actors
			split spending between safety and performance, with safety determining
			the probability of a “disaster” outcome, and performance determining the
			actors’ competitiveness relative to their peers. This allows us to
			formalize the idea of a <em>safety tax</em>, where actors’ spending on
			safety comes at the cost of spending on performance (and vice
			versa).</p>
			<p>Below we summarize some insights from this model, explained in more
			detail in the full paper.</p>
			<h2 id="importance-of-safetys-returns-to-scale">Importance of safety’s
			returns to scale</h2>
			<p>In addition to the tradeoff introduced by forcing actors to split
			spending between safety and performance, we also allow for the
			possibility that safety may be more costly when performance is higher.
			(It may be more difficult to ensure that more advanced AI systems are
			safe.) The rate at which the cost of safety scales with performance is
			critical to understanding how actors will respond to changes in the
			price of compute.</p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>We find that, when actors are identical to each other, a
			<em>decrease</em> in the price of compute leads to an <em>increase</em>
			in safety if and only if the production of safety is able to outpace the
			production of performance in terms of having higher returns to scale
			(i.e., if a uniform increase in spending on both safety and performance
			causes safety to increase relative to performance).</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>This relationship is illustrated in Figure <a
			href="#fig:claim-theta-regimes" data-reference-type="ref"
			data-reference="fig:claim-theta-regimes">1</a>. The takeaway here is
			that, if we expect safety research to require an increasingly large
			portion of compute resources as performance/capabilities increase, then
			making compute more expensive is likely to improve safety. We can
			interpret this as a reframing of the idea that slowing down AI
			development may be a good way to improve safety.</p>

			<h2
			id="monopolies-good-for-safety-competition-encourages-risk-taking">Monopolies
			good for safety, competition encourages risk-taking</h2>
			<p>When there is less competitive pressure to increase performance,
			actors are able to spend more on safety. Safety therefore tends to be
			higher if one actor has an overwhelming competitive advantage (meaning
			they are able to produce performance at a much lower cost, either
			because they are more efficient or because they face a lower compute
			price). Safety is relatively lower when competitors are evenly matched,
			and can actually be especially bad if one actor has only a small
			advantage, since then laggards might find it beneficial to catch up by
			trading safety for performance.</p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>Providing a subsidy to a single actor may have a positive or negative
			effect on aggregate safety, but safety can be made arbitrarily high by
			providing a sufficiently large subsidy to a single actor.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>This insight is not particularly helpful if we are not able to
			provide an enormous subsidy sufficient to give an actor a decisive
			advantage, since if the subsidy provided is not large enough, it may
			actually have a negative effect on safety. It’s therefore worth
			considering whom (if anyone) should be subsidized if we can only provide
			a modest subsidy.</p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>In general, subsidizing actors with a performance advantage is better
			for safety than subsidizing performance laggards, though this is
			sensitive to some assumptions.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The intuition here is that a subsidy for a performance leader further
			reduces the competitive pressure on that actor, while a subsidy for a
			performance laggard just brings them into closer competition with the
			leader(s).</p>
			<h2
			id="often-unclear-whether-to-subsidize-safety-conscious-actors">Often
			unclear whether to subsidize safety-conscious actors</h2>
			<p>In the case where we cannot give a single player a decisive edge, we
			might think that helping safety-conscious actors is a good idea. It
			turns out that this is not always the case; the effect of such an
			intervention depends on a number of factors, including what exactly is
			meant by being “safety-conscious.” The basic concern here is that
			providing a safety-conscious actor with a subsidy might encourage their
			competitor(s) to take on more risk in order to catch up, while the
			safety-conscious actor will not take on as much risk to be competitive
			if their competitor is subsidized instead.</p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>If a safety-conscious actor’s competitor believes that there is
			near-zero risk of disaster, it is typically better to subsidize the
			safety-conscious actor. However, the right course of action is unclear
			if the difference in beliefs is not so stark.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<h2 class="unnumbered" id="some-policy-implications">Some policy
			implications</h2>
			<p>There is still a lot of work to do with this sort of model, but we
			can already give some suggestions relevant for policy.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p>Increasing compute prices (or otherwise making AI progress more
			difficult) may be helpful if we are worried about safety keeping pace
			with capabilities/performance.</p></li>
			<li><p>Policies that bring actors into closer competition are likely bad
			for safety. Backing a single, dominant actor may be better.</p></li>
			<li><p>Subsidizing an actor may have an unforeseen negative effect on
			safety if competitors respond by taking on more risk to catch up.
			Providing subsidies to an actor tends to be helpful only when they
			already have an advantage and/or their competitors are very unconcerned
			about disaster.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As a general observation, simply changing prices for one or more
			actors does not come across as an especially promising way to improve
			safety. Providing subsidies/taxes conditional on actors’ strategies
			(e.g., giving a discount to actors who pass a safety audit) is probably
			much better – we are currently looking more into this sort of
			intervention.</p>
