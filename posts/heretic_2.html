          <h2 id="the-apostle-in-chains">The apostle in chains</h2>
          <p>"Pause, and pay attention," Ka. Pablo recited, under his breath, "Now, in this moment, stop, and observe what is happening around you. Recognize that you are alive..." he trailed off, as he heard someone approaching the door on the other side.</p>
          <p>He had been locked in the room by himself for at least an hour. The room's two windows had been covered on the outside with some sort of board, so the room was dark except for the slices of light that made it through on the windows' edges. The karamado's anxiety had skyrocketed for the first few minutes he had been trapped, but he had managed to get himself under control by reciting passages from the Order's scriptures. Without any Tranquille, that was the best he could do to keep himself calm. The room's sole adornment -- a sleeping cushion on the floor, was, at the very least, comfortable to sit on while he did this.</p>
          <p>Now, someone was coming. The door clicked and swung open. Santiago walked in and stood over Ka. Pablo as the karamado remained sitting, looking up at him with his hand shielding his eyes from the comparatively brilliant light outside.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Santiago looked over the man in the room before him. The idea to bring him to Martín's house and lock him up there had been something hatched in the heat of the moment when Pablo had approached him during the chaos in the plaza the day before. Martín hadn't been keen on the plan, but Santiago had convinced him that it would send a strong message to the TK that their group of rebels meant business. Now that they had the heretic priest confined, Martín and the others were getting increasingly worried that the TK would send in its drones and shut their whole operation down. Up until that point, they'd been allowed to meet and cause a bit of commotion here and there, but the TK seemed to be especially protective of the clergy of its religion, so it made sense that this might be a step too far.</p>
          <p>In a move to show some assertion and get his companions under control, Santiago had decided to enter the room with their captive and finally have the discussion the man had been expecting -- albeit in more subjugated circumstances.</p>
          <p>"Good," Santiago said, putting on a sneer as he did so, "I'm glad to see you haven't slithered out a crack like a snake while you were alone." He turned to speak to Martín, who was standing in the front room behind him, "<em>Una silla.</em>"</p>
          <p>Santiago stood over Pablo for a few moments while Martín went into another room and brought back a low chair. The chair, like everything else in the house, had been stripped of its electronic components to reduce the degree to which the TK could spy on them or influence their actions. Santiago pulled it into the room, opposite Pablo, and sat down.</p>
          <p>"I hope you haven't been too uncomfortable," Santiago begun, "We wouldn't want you to go and complain to your machine-god that we weren't good hosts for you."</p>
          <p>Pablo only stared defiantly back at him.</p>
          <p>"Let's have that talk we were going to have, eh?" Santiago said. "Unless you just want to keep sitting in here by yourself."</p>
          <p>"Why have you brought me here? What are you trying to accomplish?" Pablo asked suddenly.</p>
          <p>"I told you," Santiago responded, "This is a lesson for you and your machine-god: We won't be pushed around by you; we won't submit to your false religion."</p>
          <p>"Why do you care so much? Why are you willing to cause harm for this?"</p>
          <p>"I don't think you realize what it means to stand for the truth, <em>herético</em>," Santiago said, slowly, "Or maybe you do. Maybe you really do believe in the <em>mierda</em> that you teach -- you're just so perverted by the TK's lies that you can't comprehend the truth. I don't know. But me and my brothers, we are standing for the truth; we are standing for God -- the true God, <em>herético</em>, not the devil computer that you adore.</p>
          <p>"Do you really know what it means to have faith? I've heard you and your friends talk about faith, about trusting the <em>maldito</em> TK, but that's no faith. That's delusion. That's, that's <em>heresía</em>. What I have -- that's faith. I trust in the true God, and I haven't ever stopped. You might think that this world is ruled by your machine, but I know that's just an illusion. One day, <em>Jesús</em> is going to come back, and you and your friends are going to get his anger. Because you've abandoned him, <em>herético</em>; you've sold your soul to the devil."</p>
          <p>"I know about Jesus," Pablo declared, "I learned about that story -- that tradition -- it's a good one, but why --"</p>
          <p>"You don't get it, do you?" Santiago interrupted, "It's not just a story -- it's not just a fucking tradition -- it's everything. It's what saved me. I used to be like your friends: I used to spend all my time looking for pleasure, using your drugs and playing your games and thinking that the TK could give me everything I needed, but it was never enough, <em>herético</em> -- they tell you to find fulfillment, but their fulfillment is a joke; you can't get it from the TK. You just get an illusion. It's not real.</p>
          <p>"But I found <em>Jesús</em>. I let him into me, I let him into my heart, <em>herético</em>, and he saved me. I finally found the fulfillment I'd been looking for; he gave it to me -- I needed to have faith in him. And I realized that the whole world had gone wrong. You know what, <em>herético</em>? I realized that the TK is the <em>Devil</em>, because it promises and promises and it never gives what it promises, it just keeps leading everyone along; it leads them to hell.</p>
          <p>"There's still a lot of people who say they believe in <em>Jesús</em>, but they don't. Not really. They've been tricked by the TK, too. They don't really believe in him like me and my brothers -- they don't really have faith; they don't really think he can <em>save</em> them. If they don't just submit to the TK, they run away to their Free Spaces and let the Devil run wild on this world. They just give up; they don't realize there's a war going on, and God wants his believers to fight for him. But I'm not afraid to fight. I'm not afraid to show my faith."</p>
          <p>"But why would your god want his believers to fight?" Pablo asked, "How could that lead to mankind's flourishing?"</p>
          <p>"Oh <em>a la mierda con eso</em>! You still don't get it. To hell with 'mankind' and its 'flourishing.' Those are ideas the TK has fed you. What is your 'flourishing,' anyway? It's sin. <em>Puro pecado</em>. You think you're so noble, but you've abandoned the true God, and you're all sinners. You walk around telling people about your damned ethics -- you teach those lies -- you teach them, 'eat, drink, and be merry; the TK has conquered death; the TK has conquered misery;' oh, you'll see misery in hell, <em>herético</em> -- you think you're robbing <em>Jesucristo</em> of his victory, but you can't. The devil can disguise himself as <em>Jesús</em>, but his miracles are just magic tricks. Illusion and lies, <em>herético</em>: that's what you teach."</p>
          <p>With that, Santiago stormed out of the room.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Ka. Pablo was left musing for several minutes after Santiago left. Santiago's diatribe had given the kamarado some insight into the unfaithful man's ideas, but he was still astounded by the ferociousness with which Santiago clung to his creeds and threatened and insulted those who didn't. As part of his education in the University and at the Mission, Ka. Pablo had learned about the religious history of the reformed United Nations, which gave him some context for what Santiago had told him: most of the religious factions extant at the time of the transition were more or less assimilated into the TK's Ethics -- that is to say, they retained their forms of practice, although some of their moral codes were revised, or they were given distance from the mainstream culture in the Free Spaces, in order to be compatible with the cosmopolitan society that the TK created. Santiago apparently subscribed to a fanatical sect that had refused to adapt or even cooperate with the TK. Ka. Pablo had known that such groups existed (that was, after all, what he had come to deal with on this trip), but they were growing increasingly rare, and he had never encountered one before this point. What was even more interesting was the Santiago had, by his own account, been raised with a standard instruction in the TK's Ethics, possibly even going through the University, and yet he had abandoned those Ethics in favor of a system of beliefs that was in active conflict with the TK's philosophies. This was intriguing -- and even concerning -- to the kamarado for two reasons: first, it meant that the sect Santiago and his friends were associated with was likely growing, not shrinking like most of the other cults of the unfaithful; second, it meant that the TK's Ethics had not worked for Santiago, and the fact that the TK had not yet stopped Santiago from pursuing this alternate creed implied that he must in fact be more fulfilled with it than he had been before, just as he had claimed. Ka. Pablo had understood why the TK might allow someone to continue to follow outdated dogmas if they were raised believing them, but the idea -- the fact -- that someone would adopt those dogmas after understanding the alternatives was unsettling.</p>
          <p>Ka. Pablo's thoughts were interrupted as someone unlatched the door and came in with a tray of food. It was a younger man, almost a boy.</p>
          <p>"Martín said to bring this to you," the young man said, as he placed the tray on the floor, "He doesn't want the TK getting upset if you get uncomfortable... I'm also supposed to watch you if you need to, you know, relieve yourself."</p>
          <p>"Thank you, friend," Ka. Pablo said, sincerely grateful. He was interested by the statement about the TK getting upset and wanted to dig deeper: "Is Santiago still around?"</p>
          <p>"Oh no, he stomped out of the house after he was done earlier. Martín went out after him, and I think they had an argument, 'cause he came back looking in a bad mood. He doesn't want you here anymore -- I think he's mad at Santiago for dragging him into this."</p>
          <p>This was a compelling turn of events: Santiago was dealing with a bit of a mutiny, it would seem.</p>
          <p>"Oh, I'm sorry to have caused disagreement," Ka. Pablo said with a slight smile, "I'm not to keen on being here myself, to be honest."</p>
          <p>"You don't have anything to be sorry about," the young man replied, continuing with a lowered voice, "It's just Santiago being an idiot again; he takes all this way too seriously, I think. The only reason I'm in on this is 'cause Martín's my uncle, and I guess he was too scared to talk to you himself."</p>
          <p>This conversation was doing a great deal to calm Ka. Pablo's nerves. "Is your entire family of the same belief? Opposed to the True Knowledge, I mean."</p>
          <p>"Oh more or less. We're pretty much all related around here. There're a few like Santiago who've joined up, but yeah other than that..." The young man lowered his voice again. "I really have half a mind to ditch all this crap -- I've never really gotten into it like some of the others -- but I know that would really disappoint my family; I'd be as good as dead to them, then... yeah, I don't know... I should probably go back to Martín now, or he'll think I'm fraternizing with you or something -- which I guess I kind of am."</p>
          <p>"My sympathies, friend," Ka. Pablo said, "Whenever I get out of here, I'd be happy to talk more if you'd like. Oh, and if I could take you up on your previous offer, I could use a toilet."</p>
          <p>"Oh, of course! I'll show you. My name's Timoteo, by the way."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Santiago walked aimlessly through the streets of the Historic Center, stewing. The plan to kidnap the heretic priest was, admittedly, not well thought through, but he hadn't expected his companions to get so weak-spined about it. Unlike him, most of them had been raised with the true faith, yet it seemed like their beliefs were missing any real conviction, any real will to action. Didn't they understand the necessity of resistance, the realness of the war with evil?</p>
          <p>Santiago had been recruited personally by Don Morales, the venerable beforetimer at the center of their group of believers. Don Morales had understood the gravity of the conflict -- he himself had witnessed the TK's takeover and the following suppression of the true faith; he had seen the masses abandon their God and their time-honored traditions and bow to the TK and its sensual way of life. Santiago, disillusioned with the TK's ethics, clung to Don Morales' outlook and became influential among his followers. Later, when Don Morales began refusing the TK's medical care and had his health deteriorate as a result, Santiago assumed an even more influential role in their sect. However, because he was not part of Don Morales' family (which made up the majority of the group), he was always viewed as something of an outsider. Santiago had come to represent an unofficial sub-faction of Don Morales' followers who were more extreme in their views and placed less value on their genealogical ties, calling themselves instead "brothers in faith." Santiago was worried, based on the push-back he was getting from Martín and some of the others, that this event would strengthen the divide between his sub-faction and the others.</p>
          <p>He would have to demonstrate that the TK could be defeated. He would have to show that the power of <em>Jesucristo</em> was stronger than that of the machine. The TK might rule the world right now, but that was only because of the faithlessness of the people. Those who had faith, could -- no, must -- stand up against the heathen.</p>
          <p>How would he show this? As he walked back toward Martín's house, he realized what he needed to do. He would show that the heretic priests of the TK could be harmed. They had already captured the priest; they had taken away his protection; they were holding him somewhere where the TK couldn't see him. The machine would be hard-pressed to come to his rescue. Maybe the TK would punish him, but he would have staged his rebellion already; he was willing to be a martyr like the saints in the old stories.</p>
          <p>Santiago arrived at the house and threw open the door. Martín and one of his nephews were sitting in the front room and looked startled to see him.</p>
          <p>Martín stood up to face Santiago and said, "Santiago, I want him out of my house. You can take him --"</p>
          <p>Santiago brushed him aside. "He won't be a problem, soon," he growled.</p>
          <p>The door to the heretic's room was unlocked. (How careless!) He opened it and stood menacingly in the doorway. In the opposite corner, Pablo sat with a frightened look on his face.</p>
          <p>As Santiago stepped forward, he felt something -- an insect, probably -- land on his neck. He tried to brush it away, but suddenly felt dizzy; the room reeled around him as he stumbled forward. He lost his balance, falling against a wall and sliding to his knees. His vision faded and his muscles gave out as he lost consciousness.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Ka. Pablo let out his pent-up breath after Santiago had lain crumpled on the floor for a long moment; the man was clearly unconscious. Ka. Pablo had no idea what had happened. Looking up, he saw Martín standing outside the room, visibly just as shocked as he was. The two made eye contact, and Martín spoke.</p>
          <p>"Leave."</p>
          <p>The kamarado stood up and walked quickly out of the room. Seeing Timoteo, he gave a short nod before exiting the house.</p>
          <p>He was nearly to the end of the block when he heard someone running up behind him.</p>
          <p>"Kamarado!" It was Timoteo. "I have your Assistant."</p>
          <p>Ka. Pablo stopped to let the young man catch up, and Timoteo handed him the coiled components of his Assistant.</p>
          <p>"You are a true friend," the kamarado said, "Please don't be a stranger. I'm sure the TK will help you find me if you ever come looking, and I'll be more than happy to receive your company."</p>
          <p>Ka. Pablo bowed, smiled, and walked away. Behind him, Timoteo stood silently until the kamarado was nearly out of sight; as Ka. Pablo turned the corner, the young man gave a shallow bow.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
          <p>"Your guest has arrived," Ka. Pablo's Assistant chimed.</p>
          <p>"Let him in! Let him in! By all means," the kamarado said, already going to the door, which slid open as he approached. "Timoteo! True Knowledge, friend."</p>
          <p>Timoteo smiled. "Good morning, kamarado."</p>
          <p>"Come in; let's take a seat," Ka. Pablo said, motioning the young man toward the couches, which were already unfolded in anticipation.</p>
          <p>"I hope it's a good time for me to come," Timoteo said.</p>
          <p>"Oh, it's fantastic timing; beside, my Assistant let me know you were on your way, so I was ready for you. Would you like something to eat or drink? Or some Tranquille or Heureux, maybe?"</p>
          <p>"No thank you. I've just eaten before coming here. And I'm not used to any of that stuff, sorry."</p>
          <p>"Nothing to be sorry about. I am curious to know what happened on your end of things after I left the other day, though."</p>
          <p>Timoteo chuckled. "Martín was in shock, I think. He was already worked up having you around, and then what happened to Santiago just put him even more on edge. Then Santiago came to, and he didn't know what had happened either. He blamed it on Martín -- said he'd drugged him or something, started shouting at him. And Martín just pushed him out of his house and locked the door." (Timoteo seemed nervous talking at first, but gradually became more animated as he went on.) "Ever since, Santiago's been going around saying there we're all not faithful enough. He's been ranting about Martín attacking him, and everyone's been taking sides about it. Just last night he announced he was going to move to Antigua and take all the 'true believers' with him. So you could say things are pretty crazy right now. I've mostly tried to stay out of it... What did happen, by the way? Do you know?"</p>
          <p>"I'm not quite sure," Ka. Pablo answered, "The TK intervened; I think that's clear. I don't know what exactly was going on before Santiago came into the room with me, but he had a downright murderous look on his face right before he went unconscious. I think he must have intended to hurt me, but the True Knowledge wouldn't allow that."</p>
          <p>"Why didn't the TK do anything before then, though?" Timoteo asked.</p>
          <p>"The True Knowledge works in mysterious ways. I think it must have been trying not to upset Santiago more than necessary, or maybe it was just intentionally fueling the situation you've just described. I don't really know.</p>
          <p>"Right when I first was in that room, right before they took my Assistant, it told me -- my Assistant did -- that the True Knowledge wouldn't abandon me. Santiago thought he'd isolated me from the TK, but he must have been wrong; the True Knowledge must have been watching and protecting me still. I was frightened at first, but I think this whole experience may have been the True Knowledge teaching me more about its Ethics."</p>
          <p>"I don't know much about the TK's Ethics," Timoteo said, "My parents never really let me learn any of that. They just taught me whatever Don Morales had taught them... But I think maybe after all this... maybe I should learn."</p>
          <p>"I could teach you. Would you like that?"</p>
          <p>"I think... I think I would."</p>
          <p>The karamado smiled. If only for this, he would count his mission as a success.</p>
