<h1>Using the OpenAI API for a math tutoring app</h1>

<p>For anyone who hasn't been paying attention recently, OpenAI's latest LLMs have an impressive ability to explain solutions to questions, including programming and math problems. I wanted to explore using their API to create an application meant specifically for math training.</p>

<p>There are two basic objectives here: first, I wanted an interface that can be used to create questions with mathematical syntax and that can be repeated with different variable values; second, I wanted students to be able to get an AI-generated explanation after attempting each problem. The idea is that teachers or tutors can create a set of questions for their students, which students can attempt and get feedback on, without teachers having to create detailed solutions for each problem.</p>

<p>I created a demo of this concept, which you can access <a href="https://tutorfriend.vercel.app">here</a>.</p>
