# quevivasbien blog, now built with Svelte & tailwindcss!

To set up:
```bash
npm install
```
You will also need Python with the `markdown` package installed in order to process posts upon building.

To test:
```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
npm run preview
```

To build:
```bash
npm run build
```

Build files will be output in the `build` directory! Very straightforward ðŸ˜Š
