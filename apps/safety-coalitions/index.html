      <h2>Model</h2>
      <p>
        This applet simulates a game where two or more players compete to develop a risky technology. The players want to be the first to create the technology but have to make a tradeoff between speed and safety. Each player has two strategies available:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Baseline strategy: The player focuses on creating the technology as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>Safe strategy: The player proceeds more carefully, reducing risk but potentially taking longer to create the technology.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short, the baseline strategy is high performance but high risk, while the safe strategy is low performance but low risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first player to create the technology gets a payoff of 1. However, depending on their strategy, they may cause a disaster that hurts all the players.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the players who play the safe strategy can form a coalition: they agree to share resources (e.g. intellectual property) which boosts their performance. The performance boast scales with the number of players who play the safe strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can navigate between pages using the buttons at the top. On the <b>solver</b> page, you can adjust the parameters of the game and run the simulation to see how the players' strategies affect the outcome. On the <b>scenarios</b> page, you can explore some pre-configured example cases.
      </p>

      <h2>Parameters</h2>
      <p>
        On the solver page, you can adjust each of the following parameters:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Number of players:</b> hopefully self-explanatory</li>
          <li><b>Base risk:</b> the probability that a player who wins with the baseline (risky) strategy will cause a disaster</li>
          <li<b>Risk reduction:</b> the amount by which the base risk is reduced when a player plays the safe strategy. 0 means that the safe strategy is equally risky, while 1 means that the safe strategy eliminates all risk.</li>
          <li><b>Performance penalty:</b> the amount by which a player's performance is reduced by playing the safe strategy. The baseline (risky) strategy has a performance of 1, so the performance of the safe strategy (with zero coalition scaling) will be 1 minus this penalty.</li>
          <li><b>Disaster cost:</b> The cost that all players must pay if the winner causes a disaster</li>
          <li><b>Coalition scaling:</b> How the performance scales for the safe strategy as more players play the safe strategy. The performance of the safe strategy is the base performance (after applying the penalty), times the number of safe players to the power of this scaling parameter.</li>
        </ul>

        Note that most of these parameters can be adjusted individually for each player by ticking the "toggle individual sliders" box.
      </p>

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>
        The result shows the expected payoff for each player, the probability that they will play the safe strategy, and the probability that the winner will cause a disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        The probability that each player plays the safe strategy is shown with a colored block: red means that they will always play the risky strategy, and green means that they will always play the safe strategy.
      </p>

      <h2>Math</h2>
      <p>
        The game is modeled as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_form_game">normal form game</a> with \(n\) players. Each player chooses either the baseline (risky) strategy \(r\), or the safe strategy \(s\). The risky strategy has associated performance \(p_r\) and risk \(q_r\), while the safe strategy has associated performance \(p_s\) and risk \(q_s\). We assume that
        \[p_r > p_s \text{ and } q_r > q_s.\]
        In the applet, \(p_r\) is fixed as 1, and \(p_s\) is determined based on the performance penalty:
        \[p_s = 1 - \text{performance penalty}\]
        \(q_r\) is set as the base risk, and \(q_s\) is determined based on \(q_r\) and the risk reduction:
        \[q_s = q_r \cdot (1 - \text{risk reduction}).\]
        If the coalition scaling factor \(c\) is greater than 0, then the performance of the safe strategy is boosted by the number of players who play the safe strategy:
        \[p_s^* = p_s \cdot n_s^c\]
        where \(n_s\) is the number of players who play the safe strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expected payoff for player \(i\) is:
        \[\Pr\{i \text{ wins}\} - d_i \Pr\{\text{winner causes disaster}\}\]
        where
        \[\Pr\{i \text{ wins}\} = \frac{p_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n p_j}\]
        and
        \[\Pr\{\text{winner causes disaster}\} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n p_j q_j}{\sum_{j=1}^n p_j}. \]
        Notice that the probability of each player winning is a simple contest success function, and the probability of a disaster is simply each player's risk multiplied by the probability of them winning.

        The result shown is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlated_equilibrium">correlated equilibrium</a> for the game that maximizes the sum of all players' payoffs.

        <h2>A single risky player can cause all players to behave riskily.</h2>
        <p>
          In Scenario 1.1, we have two identical players. In equilibrium, they play the same, safe, strategy. In Scenario 1.2, we decrease the disaster cost of just the first player, and this causes <i>both</i> players to choose the risky strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an illustration of the worrisome idea that risky behavior can be contagious -- even if most players would prefer to be safe, competitive pressures cause them to behave riskily.

      </div>
      <div id="scenario2">
        <h2>Players may be able to form a "safety coalition" to encourage safe behavior.</h2>
        <p>
          In Scenario 2.1, players 1 and 2 face a high cost from disaster and are therefore willing to play the safe strategy even though they face a significant penalty from doing so. However, their competitors face a lower cost from disaster and play the risky strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Scenario 2.2, we assume that players 1 and 2 form a "safety coalition," where they agree to cooperate with each other, and with anyone else who plays safely, which boosts the performance of anyone who plays the safe strategy, with the performance boost increasing as more players play the safe strategy. This is sufficient to incentivize player 3 to play the safe strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Scenario 2.3, we assume that the benefits of joining the safety coalition are even greater, enough so that even player 4 joins the coalition (by playing the safe strategy).
        </p>
        <p>Forming safety coalitions like this may be a way to avoid the contagious risky behavior we saw in Scenario 1.2.</p>
