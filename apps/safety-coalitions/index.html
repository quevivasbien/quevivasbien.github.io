        This applet simulates a game where two or more players compete to develop a risky technology. The players want to be the first to create the technology but have to make a tradeoff between speed and safety. Each player has two strategies available:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Baseline strategy: The player focuses on creating the technology as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>Safe strategy: The player proceeds more carefully, reducing risk but potentially taking longer to create the technology.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short, the baseline strategy is high performance but high risk, while the safe strategy is low performance but low risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first player to create the technology gets a payoff of 1. However, depending on their strategy, they may cause a disaster that hurts all the players.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the players who play the safe strategy can form a coalition: they agree to share resources (e.g. intellectual property) which boasts their performance. The performance boast scales with the number of players who play the safe strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can adjust the parameters of the game and run the simulation to see how the players' strategies affect the outcome. The result shown is the best possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlated_equilibrium">correlated equilibrium</a> for the game.
