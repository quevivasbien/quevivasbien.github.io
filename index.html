          <p>Earth blazed like brilliant, bluish-white star through the window of Serĉa's compartment. Even at the unfathomable speeds at which he had been traveling, it had still taken several days to make it from the port of the O'Hare Space Elevator to the distant halo orbit of the Farm. Besides himself, his craft carried a half-dozen others -- a motley assembly of tourists, spiritual seekers, and plain-old curious folks like himself -- as well as a hefty cargo of manufactured goods for the Farm's upkeep.</p>

						I’ve been spending a lot of time reading and thinking about extending ethics — specifically, the possible answers to the question, “What should I do?” — from a personal level to the level of groups of individuals, up to the level of the entirety of humankind and beyond. My thinking on this subject is largely based on my idea of desire satisfaction as a reasonable basis for moral thinking, as well as the sort of thinking that underlies the traditional economic analysis of well-being, which is strongly rooted in utilitarianism. My interest in this stems both from a personal fascination, almost an obsession, with thinking carefully about what I should spend my time and resources doing (How is it that everyone is not constantly asking this question?), and from my professional stake in understanding how people go about translating their preferences into action and how these individual preferences and actions interact on a larger scale to produce the sophisticated social mechanics of communities, nations, and international bodies: I am about to be submerged full time in rigorous study whose theoretical underpinnings rely on specific, technical assumptions about how all this works, so it only makes sense to carefully consider how appropriate those assumptions are and how we can reasonably translate the positive declarations of empirical economic analysis (and scientific investigation more generally) into normative statements about what we should collectively be using our finite resources for. Specifically, I want to carefully consider what the priorities of human society should be and how I can use my own resources and aptitudes to contribute to those priorities.

					<p>I’ve <a href="https://quevivasbien.wordpress.com/2019/07/23/diving-deeper-with-axiom-m/">written before</a> about what I think is a good foundation for thinking systematically about morality, specifically, answering the question, “What should I do?” To summarize, the basic principle is that a person should take actions that will get that person what he or she wants. At its root, the sort of morality that emerges from that principle is more or less an egoistic preference utilitarianism, although I do want to emphasize once again that endorsing a concept of morality that revolves around the fulfillment of personal desires is <em>not</em> the same thing as saying that we should go around lying, cheating, stealing, killing, and otherwise giving no regard to the consequences of our actions on others and on future events. I personally (and I think this is true for most people) find that <a href="https://quevivasbien.wordpress.com/2019/07/08/my-passionate-and-complicated-relationship-with-effective-altruism/">focusing on the well-being of others</a> leads to highly desirable outcomes; I am also a big proponent of long-term thinking.</p>

          <p>The idea of morality begs to be extended beyond just the self, and not just in the sense of considering how your actions impact those around you, which is what I have considered before, but also in the sense of moving past the question, “What should <em>I</em> do?” and answering the question, “What should <em>we</em> do?” Making that step is the goal of this essay. Keep in mind that the conclusions I make here only hold if you’re willing to go along for the ride and first accept the premises I adopt.</p>

						If I had to compile a list of famous declarations from philosophy, I might stick Descartes’ <em>cogito</em> – “I think, therefore I am” – at the top. Descartes arrived at that conclusion after indulging in a “method of doubt” where he attempted to strip himself of all preconceptions and examine every way he might be deceived in his ideas about what is true. He finally reached the point where all he could say was that since he experienced himself thinking, he must, at least as a cognitive entity, exist. From there, he attempted to reconstruct all his other ideas about reality (although honestly his arguments from that point are a tad suspicious, and I think most people who’ve read the <em>Meditations</em> would agree with me). I for a long time admired this willingness to strip back one’s experience of reality to its bare bones, to keep asking the critical question – “Why do I believe what I believe?” – until the most basic, solid truths were obtained.</p>
            <p>Except then I started studying math. I was at first enchanted by the rigorous system of logic that mathematicians use to draw complicated (yet at the same time, beautifully simple) conclusions from a set of initial rules (axioms). I thought maybe this was a way to discover fundamental, capital T Truths about the way the universe is set up. But that was before I came across baffling results like <a title="Wikipedia is God" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel’s incompleteness theorems</a> or realized that the system of logic commonly used in mathematics, and generally in other fields like philosophy, is itself an implicit assumption that forces us to take another step back from Truth. Yes, if you start with the right system of logic and the <a title="Wikipedia is God" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_real_numbers">necessary axioms</a> to construct the real numbers, you <em>can</em> end up with the fundamental theorem of calculus (and a bunch of other fun things), but that’s only because you set things up exactly so you would be able to do that in the first place, and does that really tell us anything fundamental about the nature of reality?

					<p>As part of my <a href="https://quevivasbien.wordpress.com/2019/07/16/a-rationalist-manifesto/">rationalist manifesto</a>, I made some rather dubitable statements that warrant a bit more careful consideration. Here’s the relevant text:</p>
          <blockquote><p><em>People ought to act in a way that will get them what they want.</em>…</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote><p>Note that I am not suggesting that we should blindly follow whatever whims flutter across our minds. What I am suggesting is that we should endeavor to put ourselves in states that we prefer to all other feasible options. Giving precedence to transitory wants is a bad strategy for Getting What You Want since those desires are likely to change quickly, making them difficult to satisfy in any meaningful way. (As a general maxim, an important part of the project of Getting What You Want is wanting the right things in the first place.)</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote><p>…it’s helpful to have desires that are actually achievable. It may even be worthwhile to intentionally train yourself to desire things that are more feasible.</p></blockquote>
          <p>For sake of notational simplicity, let’s call the statement “I should act in a way that gets me what I want” <em>axiom M</em> (’cause it’s Mckay’s Moral axiom). In the rationalist manifesto, I made the claim that axiom M is the only sensible moral axiom. That was perhaps too strong of a statement – I’m open to the idea that there may be other moral axioms that I could get behind; I just haven’t encountered any yet. However, it’s clear from the quotations I’ve included here that there are some details about the deployment of this axiom that need to be sorted out.</p>

          <p>The fundamental question of morality is (according to me), “How should I act?” The mass of text that you’re reading right now is my most recent attempt to answer that question in some level of detail. The premise from which I want to approach it is the following:</p>

  		      <p>I came across Peter Singer’s most famous ideas during my last semester of high school. I was taking a class on the philosophy of ethics from UVU. After struggling through some excessively wordy defense of deontological morality, I started flipping absentmindedly through the textbook (which was essentially a compilation of diverse philosophical ideas about morality), and found Peter Singer’s “Famine, Affluence, and Morality.” I read the entire thing (as well as a few other essays making similar arguments) and was, at the time, quite convinced. <span id="more-227"></span>The main takeaways I got were the following:</p>
