# The Garden of Epicurus

## Prologue

The wanderer entered the cavernous room. It was a cave; stalactites hung from the ceiling above, and stalagmites reached upward from the ground. A pathway from the entrance led to a stone platform that rose in the center of the dimly lit space. The wanderer made his way along the path and climbed the stairs that stretched to the platform's top.

On the center of the stone platform, a man sat in a regal seat, roughly carved from the rock of the cavern. The man looked old and weak. He wore a smile that put the wanderer at ease.

"My friend," the man said, "Do you know why I've brought you here?"

"No," the wanderer said. He realized that he knew the man well, though he had never seen him in this place before.

"I've chosen you," the man explained, "I need you to help me."

"Help me?" asked the wanderer, "How can I help you? What do I have to give?"

The man smiled wider then spoke in a somber tone:

> "Just take my hands, make them your own,
> and, doing so, you'll place me on my throne."

## The hedonists

"Good morning," the room's interface said, in a characteristically pleasant tone, as Serĉa walked in, "You can take a seat here; the kamarado will be here very soon."

Serĉa walked over to one of the heavy, cushioned chairs surrounding the low table in the center of the room. He grimaced as he lowered himself into the seat, lines of pain shooting up along his legs where the gashes from his accident had left their scars. It had been only a few days since Serĉa had arrived back on Earth after his short excursion on the Farm. The TK's surveillance had meant that he had received medical attention very quickly after his accident on the mountain, but due the limited resources available on the Farm he had to be transported back to Earth to finish his recovery, and by that time it was too late to counteract some of the damage that had occurred. The scars that ran in ribbons up his legs, back, arms, and head could be cosmetically removed later, but for now Serĉa was enduring a good deal of discomfort, and it was possible that he had suffered some damage to his nervous system that would require an invasive intervention later.

The kamarado arrived just a few moments after Serĉa sat down, hurrying over to the chair opposite where he was seated. The kamarado looked to be on the younger end of things (though of course, looks could be deceiving given the TK's anti-aging treatments) and had the darker complexion and facial features characteristic of someone from the former Central American nations.

"How are you?" the kamarado asked, "I hear you've had a rough time since your accident in the Free Space. Are you recovering all right?"

"I've been fine," Serĉa answered, which was mostly true, "I got some numbing drugs just a few minutes after falling, so since then it's been just mostly uncomfortable if anything."

"Oh, that's good," the kamarado responded, "It's good that the TK was watching out for you, no?"

Serĉa nodded tiredly in agreement -- normally the TK wouldn't allow that sort of thing to happen, but since its presence was relaxed in the Free Spaces, accidents could (and did) occasionally happen there. Because Serĉa was just a visitor, the TK had been paying special attention to him, which turned out to be helpful when Serĉa's climbing expedition took an unpleasant turn.

After a pause, the kamarado continued, "So you're wanting to visit the Garden of Epicurus?"

Serĉa nodded, "Yes, that's right." His experience on the Farm had been interesting and worthwhile -- painful ending notwithstanding -- but he was definitely ready for something else. The TK had recommended he shift his attention, at least for the time being, from the Free Spaces to something quite different: while groups of ascetics and religious fanatics organized themselves in Free Spaces, the TK had also made designated special locations for members of the cult of True Knowledge (along with others who embraced the mindful hedonism facilitated by the TK's technology) to host retreats or form communities and engage in practices that might be considered disruptive elsewhere. Conveniently, one of the kamarados assigned to the care facility in which Serĉa was recuperating had just returned from a retreat at one of these places, a desert haven called the Garden of Epicurus. Serĉa had set up a meeting with the kamarado to make sure he wanted to visit the Garden before making the trip out there in his relatively feeble condition.

The kamarado didn't say anything, creating an awkward silence, so Serĉa eventually spoke up: "You recently visited? What was your experience there?"

"Oh, yes, I returned back just last week. It was an interesting experience, good overall." The kamarado paused for moment before going on: "You'll have to excuse me -- I'm a bit new to this, so I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to say -- that's the same reason I went to the Garden; I wanted to see more of what the True Knowledge has to offer. The Garden is, er, different from what I'm used to, but I guess you're probably more used to that sort of thing than I am."

"What sort of thing?"

"Oh, I mean just the pleasure-seeking, you know. The Garden is all about pleasure. Some of the people there think they can find their Fulfillment by embracing the pleasure -- the ecstasy, they call it -- that the True Knowledge can give. I think they're kind of like mystics of the TK -- of the True Knowledge, I mean; a lot of kamarados are there, actually."

"Yes," Serĉa put in, "That was my understanding. I think the TK's idea for me was to experience a bit of that pleasure after having been through a rough spot -- after having visited a Free Space, to see something a bit different."

The kamarado nodded, and Serĉa continued: "I'll admit, I like the idea. To be honest, I've never much really indulged myself before -- I mostly just focused on the Unversity -- I've been a bit bookish, I think. I mean -- I've used a bit of heureux every now and then, but that's about it. So I figure maybe I should give this a try; I'm always willing to try something new, so why not this, you know?"

The kamarado put on a shy smile and nodded slightly.

---

Serĉa left the meeting confused about what he was supposed to gather from it. The kamarado was clearly shy and inexperienced -- maybe the meeting was more for his Fulfillment than for Serĉa's. In any case, Serĉa had made up his mind to visit the Garden, and he let his Assistant know that he was planning on going. (Wearing an Assistant had not been allowed on the Farm, so Serĉa was glad to have one again now that he was back on Earth.)

That afternoon, Serĉa boarded a Metra Loop train that would take him to the Colorado Plateau Wilderness Region where the Garden was located. The train -- really more of a pod propelled by powerful electromagnets in a vacuum tube -- traveled at an exhilarating pace out of the city and over the plains. Serĉa watched out the pod's window and through the tube's clear walls as he shot through a landscape of buildings, trees, and then seemingly endless fields. The plains in the center of the continent, which had mostly supplied grains and animal feed before the TK's rise, still held an important role in food production; the quilt of fields and greenhouses was apparently quite the attraction when viewed from above, since the TK had arranged the crops in mosaics that made the region an art show for aerial travelers. From his vantage point, Serĉa could see only a wild whipping-by of plant matter punctuated occasionally by quaint settlements inhabited by those who enjoyed the open sky and rustic life of cultivating one's own food.

The trip was reasonably short -- traveling at over a thousand kilometers an hour, the Loop trains could cover a lot of ground in very little time -- and Serĉa found himself in an alien land of ruddy, orange rocks that rose from the earth in stalwart mesas and clumpy spires. The ground was decorated with spindly scrub and dry grasses whose huddled forms hinted at the harshness of the climate.

The Garden amounted to a vertical town built into a red rock cliff, along the side of a desert canyon; the meandering stream that carved the canyon still watered the plants along the canyon's floor. The complex was built in the style of the ancient American natives, although it was much larger than any of the old Anasazi dwellings that could still be found in the area.

The Loop train let Serĉa off along the rim of the cliff; at first, all he saw was the cliff's edge and the valley below, but with a bit of inspection, he realized that what he had initially mistaken for a cluster of squarish boulders was actually an array of adobe buildings centered around a partially reclining metal door set in a large, flat stone near the lip of the cliff. A tall, long-haired, and loosely-dressed individual reclined against the rock by the door. The two made eye contact, and the stranger waved Serĉa over. As Serĉa approached, he could see that the stranger had an androgynous build, with broad shoulders but a smooth neck, prominent cheekbones, and a low forehead. They exuded a relaxed air, which was reflected in the half smile spread on their face.

"Serĉa Desaĝo?"

"Yes, that's me."

"I'm Emel. Good to meet you." Emel bowed, and then went on: "I'm one of the outreach reps here. I'll be showing you around while you're here, if that's alright."

"Good to meet you too," Serĉa bowed back. "I suppose I'll just follow you, then."

Emel turned to face the door, which opened with a humming sound, revealing a short staircase below that led to a room lined with display cases, art, and video presentation stands.

As Emel and Serĉa walked down the stairs and into the room, Emel explained, "We have a bit of a museum here. It tells a bit about the history of the area if you're interested."

"No thanks," Serĉa said, "Normally I'd be all for taking a look, but right now I'm feeling a bit unsteady on my feet; I'd prefer not to stand too much if I can avoid it."

"Oh, that's right," said Emel, "You're still recovering from an accident. Do you not have a crutch?"

"No. I'd hoped not to need one, but I'm thinking now it might have been a good idea."

"No worries -- I'm sure we can get one for you here."

Emel guided Serĉa to the far end of the room, where a sleek door was positioned next to a steep stairway.

"I'm guessing you'd prefer to take the elevator?" Emel asked.

Serĉa chuckled, "Yeah, I think that'd be best."

Emel stepped up to the door, which slid open quietly, and the two entered the compartment inside. The door closed behind them, and the elevator lurched underneath their feet.

"The elevator system system can take you anywhere in the Garden," Emel explained, "If you have an Assistant, just let it know where you want to go. Otherwise, you can use this interface here" -- they pointed to a screen on the wall by the door -- "We're going to the Festival Hall right now; we have group meals and parties there every evening. I figured that might be a good way for you to get introduced, if that sounds alright."

"That sounds fine," Serĉa confirmed, "As long as this party doesn't need me to move around too much, I could use a bit of lightheartedness." In truth, Serĉa wasn't the biggest fan of rowdy gatherings, but he figured he could at least have a good meal and get a sense for what the Garden of Epicurus was all about.

After a few lurches, the elevator opened on a large space, a room bustling with people, lined on three sides with bars and buffet counters and open to a view of the desert canyon on the fourth.

A service drone met Serĉa and Emel as they exited the elevator. "I have a crutch for Serĉa Desaĝo," it said, using its magnetic handling field to offer the spindly legs of a crutch to Serĉa.

"Oh, thank you," Serĉa said, taking the crutch and letting it wind itself around his legs, giving them the support he needed to walk confidently.

The service drone wobbled in its version of a bow, and said, "My pleasure. Feel free to take a seat anywhere."

Emel guided Serĉa to a relatively empty part of the room, where a section of the floor rose up to create a table and chairs for them. "We'll be meeting a couple of friends here," Emel commented, and the table expanded a bit, with two more chairs popping up. Emel sat down, and Serĉa followed. (The crutch made the process much less awkward than before.)

"You can either go to one of the buffets or just request your food and drinks here," Emel explained.

"I'll take mine here, then," Serĉa said.

A few moments later, a service drone approached with two plates full of food. It set one, a steaming, artistically arranged array of vegetable meats, in front of Serĉa and the other, a small loaf of bread with several dipping sauces on the side, in front of Emel. As was typical, the TK used its knowledge of people's preferences and level of hunger to select meals for them based on what was at hand, unless they overrode its choices. The ability to override the TK's suggestions was, in any aspect of life, always an option: the team of visionaries who designed the TK's software had ensured that it would keep a healthy respect for the decisions of the humans for which it worked. The TK was intended not as a master for humanity but rather as a guide to give suggestions and to make decisions that humans could not easily make. It was a tool for the flourishing of humankind, a steward of human progress, a god for a secular society that was steeped in its own technology. In guiding Serĉa to the Farm, then to the Garden of Epicurus, the TK had Serĉa's flourishing, and the flourishing of all people, in mind. Even in the act of serving him a plate of vegetable meats, the TK had calculated a positive addition to the flourishing of its masters.

Serĉa and Emel nodded appreciatively to the drone that had brought them their meals, and it hummed off to attend to someone else.

"Go ahead and help yourself!" Emel encouraged, tearing off a piece of bread from the loaf the drone had delivered. As Serĉa began working on his meal, Emel spoke between bites: "The Garden is really one of the best Holistic retreats around -- I've been to quite a few, myself, so I know what I'm talking about here -- the landscape, the desert, is really very beautiful; I find myself falling in love with it more everyday. But I don't need to tell you that -- you can see it for yourself!" This last statement was accompanied by an enthusiastic flourish in the direction of the canyon outside.

Serĉa swallowed a mouthful of his meal and asked, "I'm sorry, what do you mean by 'Holistic?'"

"Oh, yeah, that's the name we've given ourselves. We're a branch of the OTK -- the Order of True Knowledge, right -- that believe in taking a, well, *holistic* approach to Fulfillment. We aren't as stuffy as the rest of the kamarados; we don't bother much with their rituals and titles and all that, 'cause we think we can approach our Fulfillment by taking advantage of all of the resources the TK's given us. A lot of people think we're pure hedonists, right, but that's not quite accurate. Well, we *do* embrace that a bit more than other people -- you'll probably be seeing some of these guys getting hot on vite later on -- but that's not all we're about. We've been trying out a lot of ways of finding Fulfillment with the TK's help."

As Emel finished explaining this, a man and a woman dressed in the same carefree fashion as Emel approached the table and waved in a friendly way.

"This is your guest?" the woman asked, then turning to Serĉa, said, "Serĉa, right? I'm Asya."

Asya's companion bowed to Serĉa and introduced himself as well: "I'm Nuri."

With his mouth full of food, Serĉa awkwardly acknowledged them, returning Nuri's bow with his head and putting on a smile as the two took their seats at the table.

"What have you two been up to today?" Emel asked.

"We spent the morning on sagesse," Nuri started, "Well I was on it, anyway; Asya wasn't. We wanted to see how a trip was if just one of us was on it -- it was fuckin' wild: you kinda get the outside and the inside perspective at once--"

Asya stepped in, "--so we'll definitely be doing that again." She turned to Serĉa to explain, "Nuri and I have a neural link -- have you heard of that?" Serĉa shook his head to signal no. "Basically, we have implants that let us share our state of mind at all times. It's really about as close as you can get to merging minds, I think. I suppose it's not too common outside Holism, though, is it? The TK must shy away from that sort of thing for the general population; I think maybe the Designers would have been leery of something that so fundamentally changed human nature and relationships."

"But it really is quite awesome," Nuri continued, "It's kind of like being wrapped up with someone all the time, except instead of your arms and legs being tangled with theirs, it's your thoughts, your mind. Of course, you're not going to want to be doing that with just anyone." He gave Asya an admiring look.

Asya smirked and chuckled, as if Nuri had just whispered something amusing in her ear. "Anyway," she said, "That was intense, so we've mostly just been amusing ourselves since then, if you know what I mean."

Serĉa didn't know what she meant but was too preoccupied with his meal to ask. In the short lull in conversation, a service drone approached the table and placed plates of food in front of Asya and Nuri.

"You're almost as quiet as that repressed kamarado boy who was here last week," Asya said, "You've hardly said a word."

"Granted, we haven't given him much space to say anything," Nuri interjected.

"Kamarado boy?" Serĉa asked, his interest piqued, "What was his name?"

"Tim... Timothy?" Asya tried to remember.

"Timoteo," Emel corrected.

"Oh!" Serĉa exclaimed, "I talked to him before coming here. He wasn't much help, though. What do you mean by calling him repressed?"

"He'd spent most of his life in a cult of unfaithfuls," Nuri explained, "I think he'd only recently become a kamarado, and he seemed so scared of everything."

"That makes sense," said Serĉa, "He was really shy when I talked to him. I'll have to ask him more about himself when I get back, though, I'd be interested to know more about growing up that way."

Emel had by that time finished off their food and, reclining in their seat, said tiredly, "Before I lose myself with an excessive dose of heureux, should we make some plans for tomorrow?"

Nuri spoke up: "We were planning on doing a sim trip. Maybe Serĉa would find that worthwhile?"

"A sim trip?" Serĉa queried.

"You've done sims before, right?" Nuri answered, "This is the same sort of thing, but a bit more... intense."

"Sounds fine to me," Emel said, "You'll get a lot from it, Serĉa; I think it's a good idea."

---

When Serĉa woke up, the sun was already high in the sky, brightly illuminating the balcony of his room. Emel had indeed taken an 'excessive' amount of heureux, then Asya, Nuri, and finally Serĉa had followed suite, and the evening had quickly become a wild display of the exuberant hedonism of the Holistics. Serĉa could still almost feel the pulse of music and the embrace of bodies from the night before.

The others were waiting in a plant-filled atrium outside Serĉa's room. When they saw him, they stood up, and Nuri exclaimed, "Ah, finally, let's be going, *dormemo*.

"You all are wild," Serĉa yawned, "I don't know how you can't be tired after last night."

Emel gave a laughing smile. "Vite, my friend."

The group took an elevator ride to another section of the Garden, arriving at a moderately-sized room lined with cubicles (which Serĉa assumed must be where they would hook in for the sim). The ceiling seemed to be made of some sort of writhing, brown-ish, light-emitting material. Suddenly it clicked as Serĉa realized that the room must have been located under the river at the bottom of the canyon, shallowly submerged beneath the current; the ceiling was made of a transparent material that let in light, filtered through the murky water from the sky above.

"Nuri, Asya, I assume you'll be doing the same trip?" Emel asked, with an affirmative response from the two of them. Turning to Serĉa, he said, "It's probably best to do it on your own the first time."

Emel guided Serĉa to one of the booths. Inside was a cushioned seat backed by an instrument that extended out of the floor like a robotic finger with a bowl on its tip. This looked very much like the other sim setups that Serĉa had seen elsewhere. Sims -- simulated experiences that could take on basically any form, from games to virtual tours to meetings with distant friends -- were reasonably common throughout the reformed United Nations, although the TK always encouraged people to keep their experiences in the real world, if possible and practical.

"What should I be expecting?" Serĉa asked as he sat in the sim's chair.

"It's hard to say," Emel responded, "Typically the TK will show you what it thinks you most need. This isn't like your typical sim -- it's not meant to be enjoyable (but it probably won't be *un*enjoyable, either; at least I've never had a bad sim trip) -- and it won't just walk you through experiences; it'll also change your perception of things, kind of like sagesse if you've ever used it. There's not really anything to be worried about -- remember the TK has your best interest in mind."

Nervously, Serĉa reclined in the chair and prepared himself for the sim to start.

"If we don't finish at the same time, we'll be meeting in the same room as last night once we're done here," Emel said, before closing Serĉa's cubicle.

## Mourning, art, and love

The wind wailed overhead, and rain pelted down through the trees.

"Wait are you waiting for, Desaĝo?" shouted the lieutenant, "Get in there and help clear them out!"

Serĉa crawled into the narrow tunnel, following his fellow soldiers. The tunnel had an awful stench of moist earth and decay, and the only light was the flickering beam of Serĉa's flashlight.

"Can't believe the V-C live in these hell holes," the soldier ahead -- Pearson -- grunted back.

Suddenly there was a tremendous explosion, a deafening sound and an all-encompassing tremor that threatened to collapse the tunnel around them. For a few moments, Serĉa couldn't see, couldn't hear.

"Oh my God; oh my God; oh my God..." someone was saying.

There was frantic conversation ahead. Finally, Serĉa heard, "Williams tripped something. He's -- he's not looking good."

They struggled on down the tunnel, like worms in the miserable, cramped space. The mud seeped into Serĉa's uniform, it caked his face, filling his nostrils with its awful scent. He felt like the walls were pressing in, threatening to extinguish him. They passed a fork in the tunnel; there was water on one side, so they took the other.

Then: "Embley thinks he's found something. It's a door."

There was a clambering to move ahead, then shouting -- no, screaming -- sounded from further along the tunnel. The screaming suddenly died out, replaced by the muffled sounds of blind scrambling.

"What's going on? What's going on?"

"It's gas! They've flooded the tunnel with gas!"

"Sons-of-bitches!"

Serĉa backed up frantically. He didn't care about the mission anymore. He just wanted to get out. The shouts and cries of the men ahead resounded in his ears. He was kicked in the face as Pearson hurried frantically to back up.

"There's no room to turn around!" Serĉa yelled.

He was at the fork. "Desaĝo!" Pearson clamored, "Through the water! The gas won't be able to reach to the other side."

Serĉa pushed ahead, taking gulps of the musty air as he dove into the stagnant water. Pearson followed behind, the two of them now holding their breath as they hoped that there was in fact an "other side" to be reached. The tunnel was too narrow to swim properly, and the sides were too slippery to get a proper grip. They couldn't see -- their flashlights had flickered off just seconds after entering the water.

Just as Serĉa was reaching the end of his breath, he bumped up against something. No. He reached around with his hands, hoping this wasn't a dead end. But he knew it was. He tried to back up, but Pearson was directly behind him, and the two became entangled, as Pearson kept trying to go forward. Serĉa kicked hard at Pearson's hands, trying to send the message: "Go back, go back!" He was out of breath now; his lungs screamed for oxygen. He was going to die here. He was going to die in this awful place.

---

The irradiated ruins of Srinagar, among the wastes of Kashmir. Klansmen in ghostly hoods and the wailing of a brown-skinned boy. The dictatorships of Latin America, installed to quell an imagined threat. The starving masses of Tibetans and the tears of the Dalai Lama. Disease and deprivation throughout the African continent.

Religion is wielded, time and time again, to oppress the other: the Grand Inquisitor executes his deity. Who is watching?

A woman wails; she has lost her child. Who is listening?

---

Serĉa stood at the base of the mountain, the Farm spinning under his feet. Ben Abn was not here; this time he would scale it alone.

He began the climb, putting one foot purposefully after another as he moved up the spiraling path. This time it was easier -- he hardly had to stop for water. His muscles burned, not with fatigue, but with determination. The valley quickly gave way beneath him; it almost seemed to fall as he ascended. The wind whipped ever harder around him, beginning to tell him its secrets.

He made it to the ridge. He would not fall, this time. The rocks ground against each other under his feet as he clambered to the summit. In that moment, the sun was directly in the center of the Farm's northern opening: it's light made a golden ring where Serĉa looked northward, into space. He stared directly at the sun, and it began singing to him.

No, not singing, but how else to describe it? He was caught up totally with a soul-carrying music that seeped into him and then lifted him from his body. All at once he wasn't just that creature standing there on the peak of a mountain -- he was also the mountain itself. He grew and became the rolling plains, the entire Farm and everyone who walked on it. He felt himself spinning in space, thrumming with heat and light and motion among the vacuum. Then he became Earth, as well: he felt the artwork of humanity shimmering upon him. He absorbed the planets, then the stars -- or did they absorb him? -- he danced with himself; he admired himself. He sang praises to his beauty and cried over his awful coldness. He span slowly, the arms of his galaxy unfurling around him, then he grew again and surveyed the constellation of galaxies that made his heart and lungs.

He was everything, and he was all time, too. He stretched back into his past and saw a single point of boundless energy, a singularity summarized in just a few wise sentences, a theory of everything.

And it ended there. Once again he was Serĉa Desaĝo, standing on the summit, feeling the wind rush over his face. But it was different now: he knew that he'd known everything. He sunk to his knees -- he didn't care that the sharp rocks were digging into his legs -- he just cried with joy. He loved it all; he was overwhelmed by love for every part of it.

The simulation ended.

---

The others must already have finished; they weren't in the sim room anymore. Serĉa's brain was still abuzz with the effects of the trip he had just been on -- he hardly paid attention to himself as his feet walked him to the elevator, and he signaled with his Assistant that he wanted to go to the Festival Hall, where Emel had told him to meet.

As the elevator door slid open on the dining hall, filled with chatting groups framed by the desert canyon in the rear, Serĉa couldn't help but feel it was all just... so small. He had been all these things. He couldn't quite capture anymore the immensity of what he'd experienced -- it wouldn't fit in his brain -- but he retained at least the feeling that the window of experience he had from his own body was just a peephole, one of many on the boiling mass of human beings, that mass itself set in the woven quilt of an unthinkably immense universe. He'd considered this before, at least in a very abstract fashion, but now it all seemed so real and immediate: "he" was just an arbitrary division in something much larger.

He stepped out of the elevator, scanning the crowd for Emel's tall profile, but suddenly experienced a wave of exhaustion; the sensory input was too much. He shut his eyelids loosely, his eyes fluttering behind their covers.

A service drone pulled up beside him. "Would you like me to guide you back to your room?" it asked.

"Yes," Serĉa muttered, "I think that would be good. I could use some time to... process."

## Epilogue

"Kamarado Timoteo?"

The young kamarado stepped into the room where his mentor, Ka. Martin, sat on a cushion on the ground.

"How can I help you?" Ka. Martin asked.

"I was wondering, there's a -- er -- phrase, that I want to know... want to know if it means anything," Ka. Timoteo stammered, "I hope I haven't bothered you. It's just something that came up on my trip."

"It's fine. I am your mentor, here, after all. What was it?"

"We did a simulation -- a sim -- and at the end, at the end I was in a cave, and there was a man there, and he told me he needed my help; he said, 'Just take my hands, make them your own, and, doing so, you'll place me on my throne.' Does that mean anything to you? I hope this isn't silly, but I think it has something to do with -- er -- my background.

"Oh? It does sound familiar," Ka. Martin mused, "Maybe my Assistant could help -- you know, if you had an Assistant yourself, it might be able to help you with this sort of thing..."

"I know; it just... still makes me uncomfortable."

Ka. Martin nodded and flicked his wrist to signal to his Assistant, which spoke so both kamarados could hear: "The phrase you're wondering about is an excerpt from the writing of the esteemed Kamarado Marsha, who has worked to reconcile the ancient Christian beliefs with the True Knowledge. It's part of poem she wrote criticizing the opponents of the True Knowledge of hypocrisy and implying that the Christian god would support the aims of the True Knowledge."

"Does that answer your question?" Ka. Martin asked.

"I think so, yes," Ka. Timoteo answered, "Thank you."

As the young kamarado left the room, he was filled with a glowing happiness, a feeling of relief. The man in the cavern was Jesus; that had been clear from the start. He had been asking Timoteo to be his hands, to represent him. Ever since he had left his family in Guatemala City, he had been trailed by a nagging feeling that he had damned himself by abandoning the god that he had known, that he was chasing after a false Fulfillment. The encounter in the sim trip had unnerved him, since he was unsure whether he was being rebuked or encouraged for entering the Order of True Knowledge. This new context made it clear that he was doing the right thing by becoming a kamarado, or at least by embracing the gifts of the TK. The TK's Ethics and technology were not incompatible with the god he had known when he was younger; that same god -- its loving, beautiful essence -- could be found, and was maybe even easier to find, in the way that the TK offered.

That night, Ka. Timoteo rested easily for the first time in several months.
